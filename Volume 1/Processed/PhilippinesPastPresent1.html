<h2 class="super">The Philippines Past and Present</h2>
<h2 class="label">Chapter I</h2>
<h2 class="main">View Point and Subject-Matter</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is customary in Latin countries for a would-be
author or orator to endeavour, at the beginning of his book or his
speech, to establish his status. Possibly I have become partially
Latinized as the result of some eighteen years of residence in the
Philippines. At all events it is my purpose to state at the outset
facts which will tend to make clear my view point and at the same time
briefly to outline the subject-matter which I hereinafter discuss.</p>
<p>As a boy I went through several of the successive stages of
collector&rsquo;s fever from which the young commonly suffer. First it
was postage stamps; then birds&rsquo; nests, obtained during the winter
season when no longer of use to their builders. Later I was allowed to
collect eggs, and finally the birds themselves. At one time my great
ambition was to become a taxidermist. My family did not actively oppose
this desire but suggested that a few preliminary years in school and
college might prove useful.</p>
<p>I eventually lost my ambition to be a taxidermist but did not lose
my interest in zo&ouml;logy and botany. While a student at the
University of Michigan I specialized in these subjects. I was fortunate
in having as one of my instructors Professor Joseph B. Steere, then at
the head of the Department of Zo&ouml;logy. Professor Steere, who had
been a great traveller, at times entertained his classes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>with
wonderfully interesting tales of adventure on the Amazon and in the
Andes, Peru, Formosa, the Philippines and the Dutch Moluccas. My
ambition was fired by his stories and when in the spring of 1886 he
announced his intention of returning to the Philippines the following
year to take up and prosecute anew zo&ouml;logical work which he had
begun there in 1874, offering to take with him a limited number of his
students who were to have the benefit of his knowledge of Spanish and
of his wide experience as a traveller and collector, and were in turn
to allow him to work up their collections after their return to the
United States, I made up my mind to go.</p>
<p>I was then endeavouring to get through the University on an
allowance of $375 per year and was in consequence not overburdened with
surplus funds. I however managed to get my life insured for $1500 and
to borrow $1200 on the policy, and with this rather limited sum upon
which to draw purchased an outfit for a year&rsquo;s collecting and
sailed with Doctor Steere for Manila. Two other young Americans
accompanied him. One of these, Doctor Frank S. Bourns, was like myself
afterwards destined to play a part in Philippine affairs which was not
then dreamed of by either of us.</p>
<p>We spent approximately a year in the islands. Unfortunately we had
neglected to provide ourselves with proper official credentials and as
a result we had some embarrassing experiences. We were arrested by
suspicious Spanish officials shortly after our arrival and were tried
on trumped-up charges. On several subsequent occasions we narrowly
escaped arrest and imprisonment.</p>
<p>The unfriendly attitude of certain of our Spanish acquaintances was
hardly to be wondered at. They could not believe that sensible,
civilized human beings would shoot tiny birds, pay for eggs the size of
the tip of one&rsquo;s little finger more than hens&rsquo; eggs were
worth, undergo not a few hardships and run many risks while living in
the simplest of native houses on very inadequate food, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>unless
actuated by some hidden purpose. At different times they suspected us
of looking for gold deposits, of designing to stir up trouble among the
natives, or of being political spies.</p>
<p>When Doctor Bourns came back with the American troops in 1908 and I
returned as a member of the first Philippine Commission in 1909, this
last supposition became a fixed belief with many of our former Spanish
acquaintances who still remained in the islands, and they frankly
expressed their regret that they had not shot us while they had the
chance.</p>
<p>Over against certain unpleasant experiences with those who could not
understand us or our work I must set much kind and invaluable
assistance rendered by others who could, and did.</p>
<p>All in all we spent a most interesting year, visiting eighteen of
the more important islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e849src" href=
"#xd26e849" name="xd26e849src">1</a></p>
<p>Throughout this trip we lived in very close contact with the
Filipinos, either occupying the <i>tribunales</i>, the municipal
buildings of their towns, where they felt at liberty to call and
observe us at all hours of the day and night, or actually living in
their houses, which in some instances were not vacated by the owners
during our occupancy.</p>
<p>Incidentally we saw something of several of the wild tribes,
including the Tagbanuas of Palawan, the Moros of Jol&oacute;, Basilan
and Mindanao, and the Mangyans of Mindoro.</p>
<p>We experienced many very real hardships, ran not a few serious risks
and ended our sojourn with six weeks of fever and starvation in the
interior of Mindoro. While we would not have cut short our appointed
stay by a day, we were nevertheless delighted when we could turn our
faces homeward, and Doctor Bourns and I agreed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>that we had
had quite enough of life in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Upon my arrival at my home in Vermont a competent physician told my
family that I might not live a week. I however recuperated so rapidly
that I was able to return to the University of Michigan that fall and
to complete the work of my senior year. I became a member of the
teaching staff of the institution before my graduation.</p>
<p>Little as I suspected it at the time, the tropics had fixed their
strangely firm grip on me during that fateful first trip to the Far
East which was destined to modify my whole subsequent life. I had
firmly believed that if fortunate enough to get home I should have
sense enough to stay there, but before six months had elapsed I was
finding life at Ann Arbor, Michigan, decidedly prosaic, and longing to
return to the Philippines and finish a piece of zo&ouml;logical work
which I knew was as yet only begun.</p>
<p>Doctor Bourns, like myself, was eager to go back, and we set out to
raise $10,000 to pay the expenses of a two-years collecting tour, in
the course of which we hoped to visit regions not hitherto penetrated
by any zo&ouml;logist.</p>
<p>Times were then getting hard, and good Doctor Angell, the president
of the university, thought it a great joke that two young fellows like
ourselves should attempt to raise so considerable a sum to be spent
largely for our own benefit. Whenever he met me on the street he used
to ask whether we had obtained that $10,000 yet, and then shake with
laughter. One of the great satisfactions of my life came when, on a
beautiful May morning in 1890, I was able to answer his inquiry in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>He fairly staggered with amazement, but promptly recovering himself
warmly congratulated me, and with that kindly interest which he has
always shown in the affairs of young men, asked how he could help us.
Through his kindly offices and the intervention of the State Department
we were able to obtain a royal order from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>Spanish
government which assured us a very different reception on our return to
the Philippines in August from that which had been accorded us on the
occasion of our first visit to the islands.</p>
<p>There was now revealed to us a pleasing side of Spanish character
which we had largely missed during our first visit. Satisfied as to our
identity and as to the motives which actuated us, the Spanish
officials, practically without exception, did everything in their power
to assist us and to render our sojourn pleasant and profitable. Our
mail was delivered to us at points fifty miles distant from provincial
capitals. When our remittances failed to reach us on time, as they not
infrequently did, money was loaned to us freely without security.
Troops were urged upon us for our protection when we desired to
penetrate regions considered to be dangerous. Our Spanish friends
constantly offered us the hospitality of their homes and with many of
them the offer was more than <i>pro forma</i>. Indeed, in several
instances it was insisted upon so strongly that we accepted it, to our
great pleasure and profit.</p>
<p>Officials were quite frank in discussing before us the affairs of
their several provinces, and we gained a very clear insight into
existing political methods and conditions.</p>
<p>During this trip we lived in even closer contact with the
Filipino<a class="noteref" id="xd26e885src" href="#xd26e885" name=
"xd26e885src">2</a> population than on the occasion of our first visit.
Our rapidly growing knowledge of Spanish, and of Visayan, one of the
more important native dialects, rendered it increasingly easy for us to
communicate with them, gain their confidence and learn to look at
things <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>from their view point. They talked with us most
frankly and fully about their political troubles.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fort San Antonio Abad, showing the Effect of the
Fire from Dewey&rsquo;s Fleet</p>
<p class="first">This fort, which marked the southern and western end
of the Spaninsh line of defences around the city of Manila, was
bombarded by the United States Fleet as a preliminary to the successful
assault of August 13, 1898, on the city. The photograph, although not
taken until March, 1899, gives some idea of the havoc wrought by the
shells which struck the outer wall. The chief damage was done when they
exploded within the fort.</p>
</div>
<p>During this our second sojourn in the Philippines, which lengthened
to two years and six months, we revisited the islands with which we had
become more or less familiar on our first trip and added six others to
the list.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e899src" href="#xd26e899" name=
"xd26e899src">3</a> We lived for a time among the wild Bukidnons and
Negritos of the Negros mountains.</p>
<p>After my companion had gone to Borneo I had the misfortune to
contract typhoid fever when alone in Busuanga, and being ignorant of
the nature of the malady from which I was suffering, kept on my feet
until I could no longer stand, with the natural result that I came
uncommonly near paying for my foolishness with my life, and have ever
since suffered from resulting physical disabilities. When able to
travel, I left the islands upon the urgent recommendation of my
physician, feeling that the task which had led me to return there was
almost accomplished and sure that my wanderings in the Far East were
over.</p>
<p>Shortly after my return to the United States I was offered a
position as a member of the zo&ouml;logical staff of the University of
Michigan, accepted it, received speedy promotion, and hoped and
expected to end my days as a college professor.</p>
<p>In 1898 the prospect of war with Spain awakened old memories. I
fancy that the knowledge then possessed by the average American citizen
relative to the Philippines was fairly well typified by that of a good
old lady at my Vermont birthplace who had spanked me when I was a small
boy, and who, after my first return from the Philippine Islands, said
to me, &ldquo;Deanie, are them Philippians you have been a
visitin&rsquo; the people that Paul wrote the Epistle to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I endeavoured to do my part toward dispelling this ignorance. My
knowledge of Philippine affairs led me <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>strongly to favour armed
intervention in Cuba, where similar political conditions seemed to
prevail to a considerable extent, and I fear that I was considered by
many of my university colleagues something of a &ldquo;jingo.&rdquo;
Indeed, a member of the University Board of Regents said that I ought
to be compelled to enlist. As a matter of fact, compulsion would have
been quite unnecessary had it not been for physical disability.</p>
<p>My life-long friend and former travelling companion, Doctor Bourns,
was not similarly hampered. He promptly joined the army as a medical
officer with the rank of major, and sailed for the islands on the
second steamer which carried United States troops there. As a natural
result of his familiarity with Spanish and his wide acquaintanceship
among the Filipinos, he was ordered from the outset to devote his time
more largely to political matters than to the practice of his
profession. He did all that he could to prevent misunderstandings
between Filipinos and Americans. He assisted as an interpreter at the
negotiations for the surrender of Manila on August 13, 1898, after
taking part in the attack on the city. Later he was given the rather
difficult task of suppressing a bad outbreak of smallpox among the
Spanish prisoners of war, which he performed with great success. He was
finally made chief health officer of Manila, although he continued to
devote himself largely to political matters, got numberless deserving
Filipinos out of trouble, and rapidly increased his already wide circle
of Filipino friends. Through his letters I was kept quite closely in
touch with the situation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I decided that the Philippines were not for me, asked for
and obtained leave for study in Europe, and in December 1898 set out
for New York to engage passage for myself and my family. I went by way
of Washington in order to communicate to President McKinley certain
facts relative to the Philippine situation which it seemed to me ought
to be brought to his attention. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8"
href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>I believed that there was serious danger of an outbreak of
hostilities between Filipinos and Americans, and that such a
catastrophe, resulting from mutual misunderstanding, might be avoided
if seasonable action were taken. I have since learned how wrong was
this latter belief. My previous experience had been almost exclusively
with the Visayans and the wild tribes, and the revolution against the
United States was at the outset a strictly Tag&aacute;log affair, and
hence beyond my ken.</p>
<p>President McKinley very kindly gave me all the time I wanted,
displayed a most earnest desire to learn the truth, and showed the
deepest and most friendly interest in the Filipinos. Let no man believe
that then or later he had the slightest idea of bringing about the
exploitation of their country. On the contrary, he evinced a most
earnest desire to learn what was best for them and then to do it if it
lay within his power.</p>
<p>To my amazement, at the end of our interview he asked me whether I
would be willing to go to the islands as his personal
representative.</p>
<p>I could not immediately decide to make such a radical change in my
plans as this would involve, and asked for a week&rsquo;s time to think
the matter over, which was granted. I decided to go.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the President had evolved the idea of sending out a
commission and asked me if I would serve on it. I told him that I would
and left for my home to make preparations for an early departure. A few
days later he announced the names of the commissioners. They were Jacob
Gould Schurman, President of Cornell University; Major-General Elwell
S. Otis, then the ranking army officer in the Philippines; Rear-Admiral
George Dewey, then in command of the United States fleet in Philippine
waters; Colonel Charles Denby, who had for fourteen years served as
United States Minister to China, and myself.</p>
<p>Colonel Denby was delayed in Washington by public <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>business.
Mr. Schurman and I reached Yokohama on the morning of February 13, and
on arrival there learned, to our deep regret, that hostilities had
broken out on the fourth instant. We reached Manila on the evening of
March 4, but Colonel Denby was unable to join us until April 2.
Meanwhile, as we could not begin our work in his absence, I had an
exceptional opportunity to observe conditions in the field, of which I
availed myself.</p>
<p>I served with the first Philippine Commission until it had completed
its work, and was then appointed to the second Philippine Commission
without a day&rsquo;s break in my period of service.</p>
<p>The members of this latter body were William H. Taft of Ohio; Luke
E. Wright of Tennessee; Henry C. Ide of Vermont; Bernard Moses of
California, and myself. Briefly stated, the task before us was to
establish civil government in the Philippine Islands. After a period of
ninety days, to be spent in observation, the commission was to become
the legislative body, while executive power continued to be vested for
a time in the military.</p>
<p>This condition endured until the 4th of July, 1901, on which day Mr.
Taft was appointed civil governor. On September 1, 1901, each of the
remaining original members of the commission became an executive
officer as well. Mr. Wright was appointed secretary of commerce and
police; Mr. Ide, secretary of finance and justice; Mr. Moses, secretary
of public instruction, and I myself, Secretary of the Interior. On the
same day three Filipino members were added to the commission: Dr. T. H.
Pardo de Tavera, Sr. Benito Legarda and Sr. Jos&eacute; R. de
Luzuriaga.</p>
<p>Until the 16th of October, 1907, the Commission continued to serve
as the sole legislative body. It is at the present time the upper house
of the Philippine Legislature, the Philippine Assembly, composed of
eighty-one elective members, constituting the lower house. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have therefore had a hand in the enactment of all legislation put
in force in the Philippine Islands since the American occupation, with
the exception of certain laws passed during my few and brief
absences.</p>
<p>As secretary of the interior it fell to my lot to organize and
direct the operations of a Bureau of Health, a Bureau of Govermnent
Laboratories, a Bureau of Forestry, a Bureau of Public Lands, a Bureau
of Agriculture, a Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, a Mining Bureau and a
Weather Bureau. Ultimately, the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes and the
Mining Bureau were incorporated with the Bureau of Government
Laboratories to form the Bureau of Science, which continued under my
executive control. The Bureau of Agriculture was transferred to the
Department of Public Instruction in 1909.</p>
<p>I was at the outset given administrative control of all matters
pertaining to the non-Christian tribes, which constitute, roughly
speaking, an eighth of the population of the Philippines, and until my
resignation retained such control throughout the islands, except in the
Moro Province, which at an early day was put directly under the
governor-general.</p>
<p>I participated in the organization of civil government in the
several provinces of the archipelago, and myself drafted the Municipal
Code for the government of the towns inhabited by Filipinos, as well as
the Special Provincial Government Act and the Township Government Act
for that of the provinces and settlements inhabited chiefly by the
non-Christian tribes.</p>
<p>At the outset we did not so much as know with certainty the names of
the several wild and savage tribes inhabiting the more remote and
inaccessible portions of the archipelago. As I was unable to obtain
reliable information concerning them on which to base legislation for
their control and uplifting, I proceeded to get such information for
myself by visiting their territory, much of which was then quite
unexplored. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>After this territory was organized into five so-called
&ldquo;Special Government Provinces,&rdquo; some of my Filipino
friends, I fear not moved solely by anxiety for the public good,
favoured and secured a legislative enactment which made it my official
duty to visit and inspect these provinces at least once during each
fiscal year. I shall always feel indebted to them for giving me this
opportunity to become intimately acquainted with some of the most
interesting, most progressive, and potentially most important peoples
of the Philippines.</p>
<p>When in 1901 I received the news that a central government was soon
to be established, I was in the Sub-province of Lepanto on my first
trip through the wilder and less-known portions of northern Luzon.
During each succeeding year I have spent from two to four months in
travel through the archipelago, familiarizing myself at first hand with
local conditions.</p>
<p>I have frequently taken with me on these inspection trips
representatives of the Bureaus of Forestry, Agriculture, Science and
Health to carry on practical investigations, and have made it my
business to visit and explore little known and unknown regions. There
are very few islands worthy of the name which it has not been my
privilege to visit.</p>
<p>The organization of an effective campaign against diseases like
bubonic plague, smallpox, Asiatic cholera and leprosy in a country
where no similar work had ever previously been undertaken, inhabited by
people profoundly ignorant of the benefits to be derived from modern
methods of sanitation, and superstitious to a degree, promptly brought
me into violent conflict with the beliefs and prejudices of a large
portion of the Filipino population.</p>
<p>A similar result followed the inauguration of an active campaign for
the suppression of surra, foot and mouth disease, and rinderpest, which
were rapidly destroying the horses and cattle. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>From the outset I was held responsible for the enforcement of marine
and land quarantine regulations, which were at first very obnoxious to
the general public.</p>
<p>When the Pure Food and Drugs Act adopted by Congress for the United
States was made applicable to the Philippines without any provision for
its enforcement, this not altogether pleasant duty was assigned to
me.</p>
<p>I did not seek appointment to the Philippine service in the first
instance. The political influence at my command has never extended
beyond my own vote. During a period of twelve years my removal was
loudly and frequently demanded, yet I saw President Schurman, Colonel
Denby, General Otis, Admiral Dewey, Commissioner Moses, Governor Taft,
Governor Wright, Governor Ide, Governor Smith, Secretary Shuster,
Commissioner Tavera, Commissioner Legarda and Governor Forbes, all my
colleagues on one or the other of the Philippine commissions, leave the
service, before my own voluntary retirement on September 15, 1913.</p>
<p>I had long expected a request for my resignation at any time, and
had often wished that it might come. Indeed I once before tendered it
voluntarily, only to have President Taft say that he thought I should
withdraw it, which I did. I am absolutely without political ambition
save an earnest desire to earn the political epitaph, &ldquo;He did
what he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During my brief and infrequent visits to the United States I have
discovered there widespread and radical misapprehension as to
conditions in the Philippines, but have failed to find that lack of
interest in them which is commonly said to exist. On the contrary, I
have found the American public keenly desirous of getting at the real
facts whenever there was an opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>The extraordinary extent to which untrue statements have been
accepted at their face value has surprised and deeply disturbed me. I
have conversed with three college presidents, each of whom believed
that the current <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>expenses of the Philippine government were paid
from the United States Treasury.</p>
<p>The preponderance of false and misleading statements about the
Philippines is due, it seems to me, primarily to the fact that it is
those persons with whom the climate disagrees and who in consequence
are invalided home, and those who are separated from the service in the
interest of the public good, who return to the United States and get an
audience there; while those who successfully adapt themselves to local
conditions, display interest in their work and become proficient in it,
remain in the islands for long periods during which they are too busy,
and too far from home, to make themselves heard.</p>
<p>Incidentally it must be remembered that if such persons do attempt
to set forth facts which years of practical experience have taught
them, they are promptly accused of endeavouring to save their own bread
and butter by seeking to perpetuate conditions which insure them fat
jobs.</p>
<p>When I think of the splendid men who have uncomplainingly laid down
their lives in the military and in the civil service of their country
in these islands, and of the larger number who have given freely of
their best years to unselfish, efficient work for others, this charge
fills me with indignation.</p>
<p>The only thing that kept me in the Philippine service for so long a
time was my interest in the work for the non-Christian tribes and my
fear that while my successor was gaining knowledge concerning it which
can be had only through experience, matters might temporarily go to the
bad. It has been my ambition to bring this work to such a point that it
would move on, for a time at least, by its own momentum.</p>
<p>I am now setting forth my views relative to the past and present
situation in the islands because I believe that their inhabitants are
confronted by a danger graver than any which they have before faced
since the time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>when their fate wavered in the balance, while the
question whether the United States should acquire sovereignty over them
or should allow Spain to continue to rule them was under
consideration.</p>
<div class="figure p003width" id="p003"><img src="images/p003.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">Felipe Buencamino</p>
<p class="first">Perhaps the most prolific writer on political subjects
whom the Philippines have produced. He was at one time a member of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s cabinet and accompanied Aguinaldo&rsquo;s mother and
son when they surrendered in order to obtain American protection.</p>
</div>
<p>It is my purpose to tell the plain, hard truth regardless of the
effect of such conduct upon my future career. It has been alleged that
my views on Philippine problems were coloured by a desire to retain my
official position. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, no
man who has not served for long and sometimes very weary years as a
public official, and has not been a target for numerous more or less
irresponsible individuals whose hands were filled with mud and who were
actuated by a fixed desire to throw it at something, can appreciate as
keenly as I do the manifold blessings which attend the life of a
private citizen.</p>
<p>I trust that I have said enough to make clear my view point, and now
a word as to subject-matter. It is my intention to correct some of the
very numerous misstatements which have been made concerning past and
present conditions in the Philippines. I shall quote, from time to
time, such statements, both verbal and written, and more especially
some of those which have recently appeared in a book entitled
&ldquo;The American Occupation of the Philippines,
1898&ndash;1912,&rdquo; by James H. Blount, who signs himself
&ldquo;Officer of the United States Volunteers in the Philippines,
1899&ndash;1901; United States District Judge in the Philippines,
1901&ndash;1905.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge Blount has indulged so freely in obvious hyperbole, and has
made so very evident the bitter personal animosities which inspire many
of his statements, that it has been a genuine surprise to his former
associates and acquaintances that his book has been taken
seriously.</p>
<p>It should be sufficiently evident to any unprejudiced reader that in
writing it he has played the part of the special pleader rather than
that of the historian. He has used government records freely, and as is
usually the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>case when a special pleader quotes from such
records, the nature of the matter which he has omitted is worthy of
more than passing attention. I shall hope to be able to fill some of
the gaps that he has left in the documentary history of the events
which he discusses and by so doing, very materially to change its
purport.</p>
<p>As public documents have been so misused, and as a new
administration is bestowing on Filipinos political offices, and giving
them opportunities, for which they are as yet utterly unprepared, thus
endangering the results of years of hard, patient, self-sacrificing
work performed by experienced and competent men, it becomes necessary
to strike home by revealing unpleasant facts which are of record but
have not heretofore been disclosed because of the injury to reputations
and the wounding of feelings which would result from their publication.
In doing this I feel that I am only discharging a duty to the people of
the United States, who are entitled to know the truth if the present
possibility of Philippine independence is to be seriously considered,
and to the several Filipino peoples who are to-day in danger of rushing
headlong to their own utter and final destruction.</p>
<p>At the outset I shall discuss the oft-asserted claim that the
Filipino leaders were deceived and betrayed by American officials whom
they assisted, and that this unpardonable conduct led to the outbreak
of active hostilities which occurred just prior to the arrival at
Manila of the first Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>I shall then show that these leaders never established a government
which adequately protected life and property, or gave to their people
peace, happiness or justice, but on the contrary inaugurated a
veritable reign of terror under which murder became a governmental
institution, while rape, inhuman torture, burying alive and other
ghastly crimes were of common occurrence, and usually went unpunished.
The data which I use in establishing these contentions are for the most
part taken directly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>from the Insurgent records, in referring to
which I employ the war department abbreviation &ldquo;P.I.R.&rdquo;
followed by a number.</p>
<p>I next take up some of the more important subsequent historical
events, describing the work of the first Philippine Commission, and
showing in what manner the government established by the second
Philippine Commission has discharged its stewardship, subsequently
discussing certain as yet unsolved problems which confront the present
government, such as that presented by the existence of slavery and
peonage, and that of the non-Christian tribes. For the benefit of those
who, like Judge Blount, consider the Philippines &ldquo;a vast straggly
archipelago of jungle-covered islands in the south seas which have been
a nuisance to every government that ever owned them,&rdquo; I give some
facts as to the islands, their climate, their natural resources and
their commercial possibilities, and close by setting forth my views as
to the present ability of the civilized Cagayans, Ilocanos, Pampangans,
Zambals, Pangasin&aacute;ns, Tag&aacute;logs, Bicols and Visayans,
commonly and correctly called <i>Filipinos</i>, to establish, or to
maintain when established, a stable government throughout Filipino
territory, to say nothing of bringing under just and effective control,
and of protecting and civilizing, the people of some twenty-seven
non-Christian tribes which constitute an eighth of the population, and
occupy approximately half of the territory, of the Philippine
Islands.</p>
<p>I wish here to acknowledge my very great indebtedness to Major J. R.
M. Taylor, who has translated and compiled the Insurgent<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1024src" href="#xd26e1024" name="xd26e1024src">4</a>
records, thereby making available a very large mass of reliable and
most valuable information without which a number of chapters of this
book would have remained unwritten. Surely no man who bases his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>statements concerning Filipino rule on the facts
set forth in these records can be accused of deriving his information
from hostile or prejudiced sources.</p>
<p>Of them, Major Taylor says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;No one reading the Insurgent records can fail
to be impressed with the difference between the Spanish and the
Tag&aacute;log documents. Many of the former are doubtless written with
a view to their coming into the hands of the Americans, or with
deliberate purpose to have them do so, and are framed accordingly. All
Tag&aacute;log documents, intended only for Filipinos, say much that is
not said in the Spanish documents. The orders of the Dictator<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1034src" href="#xd26e1034" name="xd26e1034src">5</a>
to his subjects were conveyed in the latter series of

<h2 class="main">Was Independence Promised?</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has long been the fashion in certain quarters to
allege, or to insinuate, that American consuls and naval officers
promised the Insurgent leaders that the independence of the Philippines
would be recognized by the United States. It has been claimed by some
that the co&ouml;peration of the Insurgents in the military operations
against Manila was sought for and secured. Others say that they were at
least <i>de facto</i> allies of the United States, and that they were
in the end shamelessly betrayed and wantonly attacked.</p>
<p>These are very serious charges. I shall prove, chiefly by the
Insurgent records, that each of them is false. I ask the forbearance of
my readers if, in the three chapters which I devote to these matters, I
quote documentary evidence at length. When original documents or
extracts from them tell a clear and reasonably concise story, I
sometimes insert them bodily in the text. In other cases I give my own
version of the facts which they set forth, but give the full text in
foot-notes. In nearly all instances references are given to sources of
documentary information. I greatly regret that Taylor&rsquo;s
narrative, with its very numerous supporting documents, is not readily
accessible to the student of history. It ought to have been published,
but never got beyond the galley-proof stage. In referring to it, I am
therefore obliged to use the word Taylor followed by the letters and

Department numbers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1053src" href=

few cases can give only the exhibit numbers assigned by Taylor in
printing the documents.</p>
<p>As his exhibits are serially arranged it is easy to find any one of
them. Copies of his work may be found in the War Department and in the
office of the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary.</p>
<p>Referring to the charge that the Insurgents were deceived, even had
deceit been practised as claimed, Aguinaldo would have had no just
ground for complaint, for he himself not only frankly advocated its
use, but deliberately employed it in his dealings with the Americans,
as clearly appears in records hereinafter cited.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1060src" href="#xd26e1060" name="xd26e1060src">2</a> However,
most Americans hold to a standard very different from his. Was it
departed from in this instance?</p>
<p>Aguinaldo has specifically and repeatedly charged that Pratt and
Dewey promised him the recognition of the independence of the
Philippines by the United States.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1065src"
href="#xd26e1065" name="xd26e1065src">3</a></p>
<p>Judge Blount has referred to the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i> alliance
between the Americans and Aguinaldo,&rdquo; and has dwelt at length on
&ldquo;promises, both expressed and implied,&rdquo; which were
subsequently repudiated by Consul Pratt, Admiral Dewey and Generals
Anderson and Merritt, constantly suggesting, even when he does not
specifically charge, bad faith on the part of these officers of the
United States.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1073src" href="#xd26e1073"

</div>
<p>On analyzing his statements we find that he is discreetly
non-committal as to exactly what were the expressed promises, nor does
he make it so plain as might be desired what legitimate inferences were
deducible from the acts of the Americans in question. He quotes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>an alleged statement of General Anderson to the
effect that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Whether Admiral Dewey and Consuls Pratt,
Wildman,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1090src" href="#xd26e1090" name=
"xd26e1090src">5</a> and Williams<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1093src"
href="#xd26e1093" name="xd26e1093src">6</a> did or did not give
Aguinaldo assurances that a Philippino government would be recognized,
the Phillippinos certainly thought so, judging from their acts rather
than from their words. Admiral Dewey gave them arms and ammunition, as
I did subsequently at his request.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1096src" href="#xd26e1096" name="xd26e1096src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before discussing these charges I will briefly review certain
historical facts, knowledge of which will be useful in considering
them.</p>
<p>In August, 1896, an insurrection against Spain had broken out in the
Philippines under the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo, a resident of
Cavite Viejo, who had been a school teacher, and was, at that time,
<i>gobernadorcillo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1106src" href=
"#xd26e1106" name="xd26e1106src">8</a> of his town.</p>
<p>It had been terminated by the so-called &ldquo;Treaty of
Biacnabat&oacute;,&rdquo; signed in Manila on December 15, 1897.</p>
<p>This document provided for the surrender of &ldquo;Don Emilio
Aguinaldo, Supreme Chief of the Insurgents in arms,&rdquo; and Don
Marciano Llanera and Don Baldomero Aguinaldo, his subordinates,
together with their soldiers and arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Excellent Se&ntilde;or General in Chief&rdquo; of the
Spanish forces was to &ldquo;provide the necessary means for supporting
the lives&rdquo; of those who surrendered before a certain fixed
date.</p>
<p>In actual practice what was done was to agree to pay them
$800,000<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1120src" href="#xd26e1120" name=
"xd26e1120src">9</a> in three instalments, the first of $400,000, the
second and third of $200,000 each.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo and certain other leaders were to take up <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>their
residence outside the islands. Their deportation was duly provided for,
and Aguinaldo and twenty-six of his companions were taken to Hongkong,
on the Spanish steamer <i>Uranus</i>; arriving there on December 31,
1897.</p>
<p>On January 2, 1898, $400,000 were deposited in the Hongkong Bank, to
the credit of Aguinaldo and Co.</p>
<p>The Insurgent leaders remaining at Biacnabat&oacute; had a meeting
under the presidency of Isabelo Artacho, an Ilocano<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1134src" href="#xd26e1134" name="xd26e1134src">10</a> who was
the ranking officer in the absence of Aguinaldo, and requested that the
second instalment, of $200,000, be paid to them. The Spanish
governor-general, Primo de Rivera, acceded to their request, and they
divided the money, although Aguinaldo denied their right to do so,
claiming that it should have been sent to Hongkong.</p>
<p>The third payment of $200,000 was apparently never made. Primo de
Rivera says that he turned over a check for $200,000 to his successor,
General Augustin, in April, 1898; giving as his reason for refusing to
pay it to the Insurgents that there seemed to him to be no prospect of
its being equitably divided among those who were entitled to receive it
under the agreement.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo and his associates claimed that certain reforms were
promised by the Spanish government at the time the treaty of
Biacnabat&oacute; was negotiated, and as these measures were not put
into effect, they organized a junta or revolutionary committee at
Hongkong. It included in its membership a number of Filipino political
exiles, then residing at that place.</p>
<p>The men who composed this organization soon fell to quarrelling and
it became necessary to come to a definite understanding as to its aims.
Under the arrangement finally reached, the junta, as a whole, was
charged with the work of propaganda outside of the archipelago; with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>all diplomatic negotiations with foreign
governments; and with the preparation and shipment of such articles as
were needed to carry on the revolution in the Philippines. It was to be
allowed voice by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government in any serious question
which might arise abroad, and would aid that government in bringing the
civil administration of the Philippines to the level of that of the
most advanced nations.</p>
<p>Trouble soon arose among the former Insurgent leaders over the
division of the funds deposited at Hongkong.</p>
<p>Taylor gives a trustworthy and concise account of the events of this
period, and as it is of historic interest, and makes clear just how
Aguinaldo came to go to Singapore, meet Pratt, and enter into
negotiations with him, I quote extensive extracts from it.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1150src" href="#xd26e1150" name=
"xd26e1150src">11</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;From January 4 to April 4, Aguinaldo withdrew
from the banks 5786.46 pesos in part interest on the money he had
deposited. This was used to pay the expenses of himself and his
companions in Hongkong. These expenses were kept at a minimum; the
money was drawn and spent by him. If one of the men with him needed a
new pair of shoes, Aguinaldo paid for them; if another wanted a new
coat, Aguinaldo bought it. Minute accounts were kept, which are on file
among his papers, and it is seen from them that his expenses were
exceeding his income, which could only be 12,000 pesos a year, while he
was living at the rate of 22,000, with constant demands being made upon
him by men who came from the Philippines. Life was not easy under these
conditions. Aguinaldo&rsquo;s companions were entirely dependent upon
him. Their most trivial expenses had to be approved by him, and he held
them down with a strong hand. They were men living in a strange land,
among a people whose language they did not speak, having nothing to do
but quarrel among themselves, exiles waiting for a chance to return to
their own country, which they watched with weary eyes while they
guarded the embers by which they hoped to light the fires of a new
insurrection. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The men who had accompanied Aguinaldo to Hongkong were not
the only Filipinos domiciled there; a number of men had taken refuge in
that British colony after the events of 1872, and some of them at least
had prospered. Some of them, like the members of the Cortes family,
seem to have had almost no relations with the followers of Aguinaldo;
some, like J. M. Basa, knew them and took part in some of the meetings
of the governing groups, but were probably not admitted to their full
confidence, as Aguinaldo and his immediate following wanted and were
working for independence and independence alone, while the Filipinos
who had long lived in Hongkong wanted to see the archipelago lost to
Spain, but had no confidence in the ability of the country to stand
alone or in the fitness of Aguinaldo and his following to direct the
councils of a state. The character of the new refugees did not inspire
confidence in these older men, who hoped for a protectorate by or
annexation to the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On May 6, 1898, the consul-general of the United States there
informed the State Department that D. Cort&eacute;s, M. Cort&eacute;s,
A. Rosario, Gracio Gonzaga, and Jos&eacute; Maria Basa (50), all very
wealthy land-owners, bankers, and lawyers of Manila, desired to tender
their allegiance and the allegiance of their powerful families in
Manila to the United States, and that they had instructed all their
connections to render every aid to the United States forces in Manila.
On May 14 he forwarded statements of other Filipinos domiciled in
Hongkong, not members of the junta, that they desired to submit their
allegiance and the allegiance of their families in the Philippine
Islands to the United States. One of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s followers,
writing somewhat later, spoke with bitterness of the rich old men who
went about calling their companions &lsquo;beggarly rebels,&rsquo; but
these men were rich, and their names and their apparent adhesion to the
cause represented by Aguinaldo would inspire confidence in him among
men of property in the Philippines. They were, accordingly, not to be
lightly alienated; therefore, at first, at least, no open break took
place with them, but their attitude toward the leaders of the
insurrection is shown by the fact that after the early summer of 1898
they took no, or very little, part in the insurgent movement, although
they were living in Hongkong, the seat of the junta, which conducted
the propaganda for the insurgent government of the Philippines.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;But, in fact, Aguinaldo had no just conception of the
conditions and of the opportunities which were about to open before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>the Hongkong junta, for although war between Spain
and the United States was imminent and a United States squadron was in
Hongkong threatening Manila, Aguinaldo was chiefly concerned in finding
how to avoid losing the money which had been received from the Spanish
government as the price of his surrender. The importance of his
presence near the Philippines in case of war did not occur to him, or
if it did occur to him anything which he could obtain there from the
aid of the United States probably seemed for the moment of little
consequence compared with escaping from his wrangling companions with
enough money to live on in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Artacho, who had received 5000 pesos as his share of the
second payment, arrived in Hongkong and on April 5 demanded 200,000
pesos of the insurgent funds, probably under the agreement that he
should establish a company in Hongkong for the benefit of the former
leaders and not merely of those who had accompanied Aguinaldo. But the
leaders in Hongkong had denounced that agreement, and refused to pay.
He then entered suit before the supreme court of Hongkong, calling upon
Aguinaldo for an accounting of the trust funds deposited in his hands
for the benefit of Artacho and others, and asked for an injunction
restraining Aguinaldo or any member of the junta from handling or
disposing of any part of said funds. He filed as evidence copies of the
Biacnabat&oacute; agreement and of the agreement made by the leaders on
December 19. This suit was brought not merely in the name of Artacho,
but in that of all the exiles who were described as living in exile in
Hongkong in accordance with an agreement made with the Spanish
Government. Artacho probably had adherents among these men, some at
least of whom were utterly weary of waiting in Hongkong and of living
upon what was doled out to them. Some at least saw no chance of any
other fate than indefinite exile spent in dependence upon the inner
group for even the means of existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The suit was in equity, and called for an accounting for the
trust funds which the complainant recognized were legally in the hands
of Aguinaldo. It could be carried on only with great difficulty without
his presence and without his account books. Meetings were held, and
Artacho was denounced as attempting to extort blackmail, but he refused
to yield, and Aguinaldo, rather than explain the inner workings of the
Hongkong junta before a British court, prepared for flight. A summons
was issued for his appearance before the supreme court of Hongkong on
April 13, 1898, but he was by that time beyond its jurisdiction.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He drew out the 50,000 pesos from the Chartered Bank, which
had become due according to the terms of the deposit, and perhaps such
other sums as could be drawn upon by check, engaged passage for Europe
by way of Singapore for G. H. del Pilar, J. M. Leyba, and himself under
assumed names, appointed V. Belarmino to succeed to his functions, and
gave him checks signed in blank to draw the interest of the sums on
deposit to provide for the support of the exiles. He gave as his reason
for departure that he was going to remain under cover until Artacho
could be bought off, but he intended to go far afield for this purpose,
as he gave his destination as Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aguinaldo and his companions probably sailed from Hongkong on
April 8, 1898, and arrived in Singapore on April 21, after stopping in
Saigon. War between the United States and Spain had been rendered
inevitable by the resolution of Congress demanding that Spain should
withdraw her forces from Cuba, and was declared on April 21. Although
Aguinaldo and his followers did not appreciate the influence which
conditions on the other side of the world might have upon the future of
the Philippines, it happened that in Singapore at that time there was
an Englishman named Bray who did. He had been a member of the civil
service in India, and had lived for some years in the Philippines, but
he had fallen upon evil days and was engaged in writing letters to the
Singapore <i>Free Press</i> upon the Philippines, and in retailing such
information as was in his possession concerning them to the United
States consul-general in Singapore, Mr. E. Spencer Pratt, for
transmittal to Commodore Dewey. Bray heard of the arrival of Aguinaldo
and realized what could be done with him, and that if the matter were
well handled it might be to his own advantage. He went at once to see
Aguinaldo and informed him that the United States consul-general was
anxious to see him. He went to the consul-general and informed him of
the importance of Aguinaldo, and that he was in Singapore. Aguinaldo
had to be persuaded to agree to a meeting. The consul-general was
anxious for it, and it took place, according to Aguinaldo, on the night
of April 22 (according to Pratt, on the morning of April 24). The
statement made by Aguinaldo is probably correct. According to his
account book, he paid $11 on April 23, 1898, for a telegram to the
Hongkong junta concerning the negotiations &lsquo;with
America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aguinaldo knew but little English, Pratt knew no Spanish, so
in their interview Bray acted as interpreter. An interpreter who is
interested in the subject of the discussion may be a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>dangerous man. It is impossible to say what he
told Aguinaldo. Certainly Pratt did not know; but whatever was said
during these conversations it is within the limits of possibility that
Pratt may have been made to say by the interpreter more than he
intended, and that his statements of what would probably be granted by
the United States Government and his expression of good wishes for the
cause of Filipino independence may have been translated as assurances
and as promises. Bray, who, according to his Filipino former friends,
was apt to talk too much, may have talked too much on this occasion,
and so the myth of the formal agreement between Aguinaldo on behalf of
the Filipino insurgents and Pratt on behalf of the United States grew
up, a fiction which Bray himself, with a natural desire to add to his
own importance, did his best to circulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bray did not ask for his reward at the time, but probably
reckoned upon making himself indispensable as an adviser, so that later
he could make his own terms. For a time he wrote letters of advice to
Aguinaldo, which may have had some influence upon the line of conduct
which he adopted, and later was employed in furnishing from Hongkong
news to various newspapers of events and conditions in the Philippines.
His cablegrams shortly before the outbreak of hostilities between the
United States and the insurgents were more picturesque than veracious,
but they were apparently considered effective, as Aguinaldo ordered
that he should be given $5000. He wanted more, but the Hongkong junta
did not trust him, and he ceased to be in their
employment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1185src" href=
"#xd26e1185" name="xd26e1185src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we shall see, Bray did not do all of the interpreting at
Singapore, and we shall be able to determine with some accuracy what
actually transpired there.</p>
<p>We can now consider understandingly the charges made against Pratt
and Dewey.</p>
<p>It has been claimed over and over again, that Pratt promised
Aguinaldo recognition of tile independence of the Philippines if he and
his people would cooperate with the United States forces against
Spain.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo himself made the charge in his &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a
Ver&iacute;dica&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1196src" href=
"#xd26e1196" name="xd26e1196src">13</a> in the following words:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In this interview Consul Pratt told me that
because the Spaniards had not complied with the agreement of
Biac-na-bat&oacute;, the Filipinos had a right to renew their
interrupted revolution and advised me to take up arms anew against
Spain, assuring me that America would give the Filipinos the greatest
advantages (mayores ventajas). Then I asked the Consul what advantages
the United States would concede to the Philippines, suggesting, when I
had the proper opening, the propriety of making an agreement in
writing, to which the Consul answered that he would report, by
telegraph, on the subject to Mr. Dewey, who was the chief of the
expedition against the Philippines, and who had ample powers from
President McKinley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following day, between 10 and 12 in the morning, we
again took up the matter, Consul Pratt saying that the admiral had
answered my inquiry by saying that the United States would at least
recognize the independence of the Philippine government under a naval
protectorate, but that there was no necessity to put it in writing, as
the words of the admiral and the American consul were sacred and would
be fulfilled, not being like those of the Spaniards, and finally, that
the Government of North America was a very honourable Government, a
very just and very powerful one.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1208src" href="#xd26e1208" name="xd26e1208src">14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 27, 1908, Pratt telegraphed the Secretary of State as
follows: &mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"></p>
<div class="body">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 28th he wrote the Secretary, explaining how he had come to
meet Aguinaldo, and stating just what he had done. He said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At this interview, after learning from General
Aguinaldo the state of an object sought to be obtained by the present
insurrectionary movement, which, though absent from the Philippines, he
was still directing, I took it upon myself, whilst explaining that I
had no authority to speak for the Government, to point out the danger
of continuing independent action at this stage; and, having convinced
him of the expediency of cooperating with our fleet, then at Hongkong,
and obtained the assurance of his willingness to proceed thither and
confer with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=

desire, I telegraphed the Commodore the same day as follows, through

</blockquote>
<p>The Commodore&rsquo;s reply read thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Tell Aguinaldo come soon as
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class=
"sc">Dewey</span>.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pratt adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I received it late at night, and at once
communicated to General Aguinaldo, who, with his aide-de-camp and
private secretary, all under assumed names, I succeeded in getting off
by the British Steamer <i>Malacca</i>, which left here on Tuesday the
26th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just previous to his departure, I had a second and last
interview with General Aguinaldo, the particulars of which I shall give
you by next mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general impressed me as a man of intelligence, ability,
and courage, and worthy the confidence that had been placed in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that in arranging for his direct cooperation with the
commander of our forces, I have prevented possible conflict of action
and facilitated the work of occupying and administering the
Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this course of mine meets with the Government&rsquo;s
approval, as I trust it may, I shall be fully satisfied; to Mr. Bray,
however, I consider there is due some special recognition for most
valuable services rendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How that recognition can best be made I leave to you to
decide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1279src" href=
"#xd26e1279" name="xd26e1279src">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that Pratt explained to Aguinaldo that he had no
authority to speak for the government; that there was no mention in the
cablegrams between Pratt and Dewey of independence or indeed of any
conditions on which Aguinaldo was to co&ouml;perate, these details
being left for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>future arrangement with Dewey; and that Pratt
thought that he had prevented possible conflict of action and
facilitated the work of occupying and administering the
Philippines.</p>
<p>The particulars as to the second and last interview between
Aguinaldo and Pratt were embodied in the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;No. 213. <span class="sc">Consulate-General of
the United States.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Singapore</span>, April 30, 1898.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sir</span>: Referring to my dispatch No.
212, of the 28th instant, I have the honor to report that in the second
and last interview I had with Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo on the eve of his
departure for Hongkong, I enjoined upon him the necessity, under
Commodore Dewey&rsquo;s direction, of exerting absolute control over
his forces in the Philippines, as no excesses on their part would be
tolerated by the American Government, the President having declared
that the present hostilities with Spain were to be carried on in strict
accord with modern principles of civilized warfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this General Aguinaldo fully assented, assuring me that he
intended and was perfectly able, once on the field, to hold his
followers, the insurgents, in check and lead them as our commander
should direct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general stated that he hoped the United States would
assume protection of the Philippines for at least long enough to allow
the inhabitants to establish a government of their own, in the
organization of which he would desire American advice and
assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These questions I told him I had no authority to discuss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, etc.,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">E. Spencer Pratt</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>United States Consul-General</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a subsequent communication written on July 28, 1898, Pratt made
the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I declined even to discuss with General
Aguinaldo the question of the future policy of the United States with
regard to the Philippines, that I held out no hopes to him of any kind,
committed the government in no way whatever, and, in the course of our
confidences, never acted upon the assumption that the Government would
cooperate with him&mdash;General Aguinaldo&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>for the
furtherance of any plans of his own, nor that, in accepting his said
cooperation, it would consider itself pledged to recognize any
political claims which he might put forward.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1334src" href="#xd26e1334" name="xd26e1334src">16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What reason if any is there for denying the truth of this
allegation?</p>
<p>I will give in full Blount&rsquo;s statement as to what occurred at
a meeting held at Singapore, to celebrate the early successes of Dewey
and Aguinaldo, as it constitutes his nearest approach to a direct
claim, that any one at any time promised independence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;First there was music by the band. Then
followed the formal reading and presentation of the address by a Dr.
Santos, representing the Filipino community of Singapore. The address
pledged the &lsquo;eternal gratitude&rsquo; of the Filipino people to
Admiral Dewey and the honored addressee; alluded to the glories of
independence, and to how Aguinaldo had been enabled; by the arrangement
so happily effected with Admiral Dewey by Consul Pratt, to arouse eight
millions of Filipinos to take up arms &lsquo;in defence of those
principles of justice and liberty of which your country is the foremost
champion&rsquo; and trusted &lsquo;that the United
States&#8202;&hellip; will efficaciously second the programme arranged
between you, sir, and General Aguinaldo in this port of Singapore, and
secure to us our independence under the protection of the United
States.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pratt arose and &lsquo;proceeded, speaking in
French,&rsquo; says the newspaper&mdash;it does not say Alabama French,
but that is doubtless what it was&mdash;&lsquo;to state his belief that
the Filipinos would prove and were now proving themselves fit for
self-government.&rsquo; The gentleman from Alabama then went on to
review the mighty events and developments of the preceding six weeks,
Dewey&rsquo;s victory of May 1st, &lsquo;the brilliant achievements of
your own distinguished leader, General Emilio Aguinaldo, <i>cooperating
on land with the Americans at sea</i>,&rsquo; etc. &lsquo;You have just
reason to be proud of what has been and is being accomplished by
General Aguinaldo and your fellow-countrymen under his command. When,
six weeks ago, I learned that General Aguinaldo had arrived
<i>incognito</i> in Singapore, I immediately <i>sought him out</i>. An
hour&rsquo;s interview convinced me that he <i>was the man for the
occasion</i>; and, having communicated with Admiral Dewey, I
accordingly arranged for him to join the latter, which he did at
Cavite. The rest you know.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

<p>Now, it happens that Dr. Santos himself forwarded his speech, and
his version of Pratt&rsquo;s reply thereto, in a letter to Aguinaldo,
dated Singapore, June 9, 1898. As he served as interpreter, he, if any
one, should know what Pratt said. After describing the change in tone
of the Singapore <i>Free Press</i>, with which strained relations had
formerly existed, and the subsequent friendliness of the editor of this
paper and that of the <i>Straits Times</i>, he says that on the
previous afternoon he went with the other Filipinos to greet Pratt. He
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This occasion was unusually opportune by reason
of ours having been victorious and immediately after the cry of our
worthy chief which found an echo in this colony. For this purpose 30 or
more Filipinos&mdash;9 of the higher class, 15 musicians and the
remainder of the middle class&mdash;went to greet Consul A., here, and
on the invitation of Mr. Bray we ascended. He received us in his
private office, and it was imposing to see that the only decoration was
the American flag which covered the desk, and in its centre, a carved
wooden frame holding the portrait of our worthy chief. He shook hands
with all of us, and I introduced them all. We found there also, and
were introduced to, the Editor of the <i>Straits Times</i> and the
<i>Free Press</i> of here, and after being thus assembled, after a
musical selection, I read the following speech in French:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">His Excellency,
The Consul General of the United States of America in
Singapore</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">Your Excellency</span>: The
Filipinos of all social classes residing in this port, have come to
greet Your Excellency as the genuine representative of the great and
powerful American Republic in order to express to you our eternal
gratitude for the moral and material support given by Admiral Dewey to
our General Aguinaldo in his campaign for the liberty of eight million
Filipinos. The latter and we ourselves hope that the United States,
your nation, persevering in its humanitarian policy, will without
cessation and (with) decided energy continue to support the programme
agreed upon in Singapore between Your Excellency and General Aguinaldo,
that is to say, the Independence of the Philippine Islands, under an
American protectorate. Accept our cordial acknowledgments and
congratulations on being the first one in accepting and supporting this
idea which time and events have well developed to the great
satisfaction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>of our nation. Finally, we request you, Most
Excellent Sir, to express to your worthy President and the American
Republic, our sincere acknowledgments and our fervent wishes for their
prosperity. I have concluded.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Consul replied hereto in French, in more or less the
following terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;You have nothing to thank me for, because I
have only faithfully followed the instructions received from my
Government; the fact of the sudden departure of your General will
permit you to infer that I have done so. I shall in any case inform my
Government of your good wishes and I thank you in its name. You know
that your wishes are mine also, and for this reason at the last
interview I had with Mr. Aguinaldo, I repeated to him that he should
observe the greatest humanity possible in the war, in order that our
army, our soldiers, our nation and all the other nations may see that
you are humane and not savages, as has erroneously been
believed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this there was enthusiastic applause for the Consul; he
offered us all cigars, glasses of very fine sherry, and lemonade for
the musicians and the majority. The toasts were offered with the sherry
by your humble servant, Sres. Cannon, Enr&iacute;quez, Celio, Reyes,
the Consul, the editors of the <i>Free Press</i>, <i>Straits Times</i>
and Mr. Bray. We drank to America and her humanitarian work of
redemption; to the Philippines with America; we gave thanks to the
Consul, to Mr. Bray as an important defender; we drank to the <i>Free
Press</i> for taking such an interest in our affairs, and to the
<i>Straits Times</i> (sarcastically); but I was very careful not to
propose a toast to our general, which was done at the proper time by
&lsquo;Flaco&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1411src" href=
"#xd26e1411" name="xd26e1411src">18</a> when we gave three cheers; for
the sake of courtesy we cheered for England, which had been so
hospitable to us, and when everybody had become quiet, the Editor of
the <i>Straits Times</i> took his glass in his hand and cried in a loud
voice, &lsquo;The Philippine Republic,&rsquo; to which we all
responded. &lsquo;Flaco&rsquo; disappeared a moment, and when he
returned he brought with him the American flag, and formally presented
it to us in French, which I interpreted to all in Spanish, as follows:
&lsquo;Gentlemen: The American Consul, with his deep affection for us,
presents us this flag as the greatest and most expressive remembrance
which he can give us. The red stripes stand for the generous blood of
her sons, shed to obtain her liberty; the white stripes stand for her
virginity and purity as our country; the blue background indicates the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>sky and each star represents a free and
independent State; this is America, and the Consul is desirous that we
also should have so glorious a history as hers and that it may be as
brilliant as could be wished, securing peace with respect, and may God
be our help and guide in securing liberty. Viva and with it our most
sincere thanks for so signal a courtesy.&rsquo; Hereupon, to the
surprise of everybody as no one expected it, the Consul requested that
some Filipino airs be played which seemed to please him very much.
Finally, about 6.15, we left, very well satisfied with the reception
accorded us and the kindness of the Consul. Mr. Bray asked me for the
text of my speech, which I insert above and I secured from the Consul
his French text, which I enclose in my letter to Naning. Without
anything further for the present, awaiting your reply and your opinion
as to the above, as also orders and instructions for the future, I
am,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours, etc.</p>
<p>(Signed) &ldquo;<span class="sc">Isidoro de los
Santos</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this letter Major Taylor has appended the following
note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;(<i>Note by Compiler.</i>&mdash;In a letter
written in Tagalog to Aguinaldo on June 6 by Santos he describes the
American consul general as having cried out &lsquo;Hurrah for General
Aguinaldo, hurrah for the Republic of the Philippines&rsquo; and then,
having apparently taken several drinks, he passed up and down the room
waving the American flag before giving it to the assembled Filipinos
(P.I.R., 406.7).)&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1436src" href=
"#xd26e1436" name="xd26e1436src">19</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This final statement does not present the representative of the
United States government at Singapore in a very favourable light, but I
take the facts as I find them. If now we compare the speech actually
made by Dr. Santos with Blount&rsquo;s version of it, we shall find
that with the exception of the words &ldquo;eternal gratitude&rdquo;
the passages which he encloses in quotation marks are not in the
original at all. The glories of independence are not alluded to, nor is
there so much as a suggestion that Aguinaldo had been enabled to arouse
eight millions of Filipinos to take up arms, which he certainly had not
done. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dr. Santos in his speech did resort to a stereotyped Filipino
procedure so very commonly employed that those of us who have dealt
much with his people have learned to meet it almost automatically. It
consists in referring to one&rsquo;s having said just exactly what one
did not say, and then if one fails to note the trap and avoid it, in
claiming that because one did not deny the allegation one has admitted
its truth.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo himself later repeatedly resorted to this procedure in his
dealings with Dewey and others.</p>
<p>In the present instance Santos employed it rather cleverly when he
expressed the hope that the United States would &ldquo;continue to
support the programme agreed upon in Singapore, between your Excellency
and General Aguinaldo, that is to say, the independence of the
Philippine Islands under an American protectorate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now if this was agreed to, Aguinaldo later constantly violated his
part of the agreement, for we shall see that he stated over and over
again, in correspondence with members of the junta and others, that a
protectorate would be considered only if absolute independence finally
proved unattainable, but there is no reason to believe that any such
agreement was made.</p>
<p>Dr. Santos read his speech to Mr. Pratt in French. Blount implies,
whether rightly or wrongly I do not know, that Pratt&rsquo;s knowledge
of French was poor. At all events Pratt in his reply made not the
slightest reference to the hope expressed by Santos that the United
States would continue to support the programme which Santos said had
been agreed upon between Pratt and Aguinaldo, and claim of a promise of
independence based on these speeches must obviously be abandoned. There
is no doubt that Pratt personally sympathized with the ambitions of the
Filipino leaders, and openly expressed his sympathy on this and other
occasions, but to do this was one thing and to have attempted to
compromise his government would have been another and very different
one. The shrewd <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>Filipinos with whom he was dealing understood this
difference perfectly well.</p>
<p>It is a regrettable fact that there exists some reason to believe
that his sympathy was not purely disinterested. Aguinaldo claims that
Pratt wished to be appointed &ldquo;representative of the Philippines
in the United States to promptly secure the official recognition of our
independence&rdquo; and that he promised him &ldquo;a high post in the
customs service.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1457src" href=
"#xd26e1457" name="xd26e1457src">20</a></p>
<p>It will be noted that several sentences and phrases in
Blount&rsquo;s statement are enclosed in quotation marks. From what
were they quoted? The next paragraph in his book tells us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Says the newspaper clipping which has preserved
the Pratt oration: At the conclusion of Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s speech,
refreshments were served, and as the Filipinos, <i>being Christians,
drink alcohol</i>, there was no difficulty in arranging as to
refreshments.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1468src" href=
"#xd26e1468" name="xd26e1468src">21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of this clipping from the Singapore <i>Free Press</i>
illustrates admirably Blount&rsquo;s methods. The <i>Free Press</i> had
at first displayed a marked coldness toward the insurgent cause, but
its editor, Mr. St. Clair, was opportunely &ldquo;seen&rdquo; by Bray,
who reported that as a result of his visit, both the editor and the
paper would thereafter be friendly, and they were. In other words, the
<i>Free <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>Press</i> became the Singapore organ of the
insurrection, and its editor, according to Bray, &ldquo;a true and
loyal friend&rdquo; of Aguinaldo.</p>
<div class="figure p006width" id="p006"><img src="images/p006.jpg" alt=
"Typical Insurgent Trenches" width="720" height="428">
<p class="figureHead">Typical Insurgent Trenches</p>
<p class="first">The Insurgents built long lines of well-constructed
trenches from which they could escape without exposing themselves to
the fire of the American troops.</p>
</div>
<p>Blount claims to have made &ldquo;an exhaustive examination of the
records of that period.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1493src"
href="#xd26e1493" name="xd26e1493src">22</a> Why then did he use as
evidence a newspaper clipping from an Insurgent organ, instead of
Santos&rsquo;s letter?</p>
<p>Blount endeavours to make capital out of the fact that Pratt
forwarded to the State Department a proclamation which he says was
gotten up by the Insurgent leaders at Hongkong and sent to the
Philippines in advance of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s coming. He says that it was
headed &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Allies&rdquo; and quotes from it as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Compatriots: Divine Providence is about to
place independence within our reach&#8202;&hellip;. The Americans, not
from mercenary motives, but for the sake of humanity and the
lamentations of so many persecuted people, have considered it
opportune, etc. [Here follows a reference to Cuba.] At the present
moment an American squadron is preparing to sail for the
Philippines&#8202;&hellip;. The Americans will attack by sea and
prevent any re&euml;nforcements coming from Spain; &hellip; we
insurgents must attack by land. Probably you will have more than
sufficient arms, because the Americans have arms and will find means to
assist us. <i>There where you see the American flag flying, assemble in
numbers; they are our redeemers!</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1504src" href="#xd26e1504" name="xd26e1504src">23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The translation that he used is that given in Senate Document No.
62, L. 60, and is none too accurate. He allows it to be inferred that
this proclamation was actually issued. It was not. Its history is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>On May 16, 1898, J. M. Basa, a Filipino, who had lived in Hongkong
since 1872, on account of his connection with the troubles of that
year, wrote letters<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1511src" href=
"#xd26e1511" name="xd26e1511src">24</a> to a number <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>of
friends recommending the widest possible circulation of a proclamation
enclosed therewith, as an aid to the American policy in the Philippines
&ldquo;in the war against the tyrannical friars and the
Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these letters there were sent two different proclamations, each
beginning with the words &ldquo;Fellow Countrymen.&rdquo; The first,
which is the one referred to by Blount, continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Divine Providence places us in a position to
secure our independence, and this under the freest form to which all
individuals, all people, all countries, may aspire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Americans, more for humanity than for self-interest,
attentive to the complaints of so many persecuted Filipinos, find it
opportune to extend to our Philippines their protective mantle, now
that they find themselves obliged to break their friendship with the
Spanish people, because of the tyranny they have exercised in Cuba,
causing all Americans, with whom they have great commercial relations,
enormous damages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment an American fleet is prepared to go to the
Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, your fellow-countrymen, fear that you will make use of
your arms to fire upon the Americans. No, brothers; do not make such a
mistake; rather (shoot) kill yourselves than treat our liberators as
enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not pay attention to the decree of Primo de Rivera,
calling on you to enlist for the war, for that will cost you your
lives: rather die than act as ingrates toward our redeemers, the
Americans.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Note well that the Americans have to attack by sea, at the
same time avoiding reinforcements which may come from Spain; therefore
the insurrection must attack by land. Perhaps <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>you will
have more than sufficient arms, as the Americans have arms, and will
find the means to aid you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you see the American flag, bear in mind that they
are our redeemers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1560src" href=
"#xd26e1560" name="xd26e1560src">25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the margin is written: &ldquo;Viva, for America with the
Philippines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently what Basa here means by independence is independence from
Spain, for it is known that he was in favour of annexation to the
United States, and in the second proclamation we find the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This is the best opportunity which we have ever
had for contriving that our country (all the Philippine Archipelago)
may be counted as another Star in the Great Republic of the United
States, great because of its wisdom, its wealth, and its constitutional
laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time to offer ourselves to that great nation. With
America we shall have development in the broadest sense (of
advancement) in civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With America we shall be rich, civilized and happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow patriots, add your signatures to those which have
already been given. Explain to all our fellow countrymen the benefits
of this change, which will be blessed by Heaven, by men and by our
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Viva America with the Philippines!!!&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1579src" href="#xd26e1579" name="xd26e1579src">26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letters were undoubtedly given to Aguinaldo for delivery on his
arrival. They were never delivered, and it is reasonable to suppose,
especially as Basa, who was a man of importance and means, was a member
of the group who desired annexation to the United States, that
Aguinaldo took the letters along in order to avoid a rupture with him
and then quietly suppressed them. Obviously, however, he sent or gave a
copy of the first one to Pratt, presumably without the written words:
&ldquo;Viva, for America with the Philippines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now comes a bit of evidence as to what occurred at Singapore
which I consider incontrovertible.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo returned promptly to Hongkong and on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>May 4,
1898, a meeting of the junta was held. The minutes of this
meeting,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1590src" href="#xd26e1590" name=
"xd26e1590src">27</a> signed by each of the several Filipinos present,
form a part of the Insurgent records which have come into the
possession of the United States Government. They state among other
things that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The temporary Secretary read the minutes of the
preceding meeting, which were approved. The temporary President
reported that D. Emilio Aguinaldo had just arrived from Singapore and
it became necessary for him to take possession of the office to which
he has been elected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the transaction of some further business Aguinaldo was
summoned, appeared at the meeting, and was duly installed as President.
Then:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The President described the negotiations which
took place during his absence in Singapore with the American Consul of
that English colony. Both agreed that the President should confer with
the Admiral commanding the American squadron in Mirs Bay, and if the
latter should accept his propositions, advantageous, in his judgment,
to the Philippines, he would go to said country in one of the cruisers
which form the fleet for the purpose of taking part in the present
events. And as he did not find the Admiral, he thought it well to have
an interview with the American Consul of this colony on the day of his
arrival, but was not satisfied with such interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering the critical conditions in the Philippines at
present, he begged the committee to discuss the advisability of his
going to said islands with all the leaders of prominence in the last
rebellion residing in this colony, in case the Admiral gave them an
opportunity to do so.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that there is here absolutely not one word of any promise of
independence made to Aguinaldo by Pratt or any one else. Is it
conceivable that Aguinaldo in describing &ldquo;the negotiations which
took place during his absence in Singapore with the American Consul of
the English Colony&rdquo; would, by any chance, have failed to inform
his associates in Hongkong of such an extraordinary and fortunate
occurrence as the promising by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"
href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>Mr. Pratt and Admiral Dewey that
the United States would recognize Philippine independence?</p>
<p>Sandico<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1611src" href="#xd26e1611" name=
"xd26e1611src">28</a> thought that Aguinaldo ought to go,
for&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;From conferences which he had with the Admiral
of the American fleet and with the American Consul in this colony, he
believed that under present conditions it was absolutely necessary for
the President to go to the Philippines, since, according to the
American Consul, Manila had been taken by said fleet, and a provisional
government was now being formed in that capital. The intervention of
the President in the formation of that government is undoubtedly
essential, since his prestige, which everybody recognizes, would
evidently prevent dissensions among the sons of the country, and it
would be possible thereby to obtain a perfect organization both for the
military and civil evolution of that country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Srs. Garchitorena<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1619src" href=
"#xd26e1619" name="xd26e1619src">29</a> and Apacible<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1622src" href="#xd26e1622" name="xd26e1622src">30</a>
expressed themselves in similar terms. Notwithstanding the previous
remarks, the President insisted that he considered it reckless for him
to go to the Philippines without first making a written agreement with
the Admiral, as it might happen, if he placed himself at his orders,
that he might make him subscribe to or sign a document containing
proposals highly prejudicial to the interests of the country, from
which might arise the following two very grave contingencies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st. If he should accept them, he would undoubtedly commit an
unpatriotic act, and his name would justly be eternally cursed by the
Filipinos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2d. If he should refuse, then the break between the two would
be evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to avoid this sad dilemma, he proposed to the committee
that the four parties (?) of the insurgents now here, under charge of
the competent chiefs authorized in writing by him, should go to the
Philippines to intervene, after a conference with the Admiral, in these
important questions; such means, in his opinion, should be first
employed to ascertain in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>an authentic manner what the
intentions of the United States in regard to that country are; and if
his intervention is absolutely necessary, he would not object to go at
once to the Philippines, endeavouring by all the means in his power to
remedy the critical condition of the country, to which he had offered,
and always would willingly offer, to sacrifice his life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why adopt means to learn from the admiral what the intentions of the
United States were in regard to the Philippines if both he and Pratt
had already promised recognition of independence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Srs. Sandico, Garchitorena, Gonzaga<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1639src" href="#xd26e1639" name=
"xd26e1639src">31</a> and Apacible replied that they were fully
convinced the Admiral of the American squadron would furnish the
President all the arms which he might desire, since the former was
convinced that the fleet could do nothing in the Philippines unless it
were used in conjunction with the insurgents in the development of
their plans of war against the Spanish government&#8202;&hellip;. The
authority to treat which the President desired to give to the other
chiefs, without reflecting at all upon their personal qualifications,
they did not believe would be as efficacious as his personal
intervention which is necessary in grave affairs, such as those the
subject of discussion; there would be no better occasion than that
afforded them to insure the landing of the expeditionary forces on
those islands and to arm themselves at the expense of the Americans and
to assure the situation of the Philippines in regard to our legitimate
aspirations against those very people. The Filipino people, unprovided
with arms, would be the victims of the demands and exactions of the
United States; but, provided with arms, would be able to oppose
themselves to them, struggling for independence, in which consists the
true happiness of the Philippines. And they finished by saying that it
made no difference if the Spanish government did demand the return of
the &#8369;400,000, and if the demand were allowed in an action, since
the object of the sum would be obtained by the Admiral furnishing the
Filipinos the arms which they required for the struggle for their
legitimate aspirations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, then, was a definite plan to obtain arms from the Americans to
be used if necessary &ldquo;against those very people&rdquo; later.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The President, with his prestige in the
Philippines, would be able to arouse those masses to combat the demands
of the United States, if they colonized that country, and would drive
them, if circumstances rendered it necessary, to a Titanic struggle for
their independence, even if they should succumb in shaking off the yoke
of a new oppressor. If Washington proposed to carry out the fundamental
principles of its constitution, there was no doubt that it would not
attempt to colonize the Philippines, or even to annex them. It was
probable then that it would give them independence and guarantee it; in
such case the presence of the President was necessary, as he would
prevent dissensions among the sons of the country who sought office,
who might cause the intervention of European powers, an intervention
which there was no reason to doubt would be highly prejudicial to the
interests of the country&#8202;&hellip;. What injury could come to the
Philippines, even if we admitted that the Admiral would not give arms
to the President on account of his refusal to sign a document
prejudicial to the country, after he had taken all means to provide for
her defence? None. Such an act of the President could not be censured,
but, on the other hand, would be most meritorious, because it would be
one proof more of his undoubted patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not one word of any promise of independence do we find in this
remarkable document. On the contrary it furnishes conclusive proof that
no such promise had been made and that the future relations between
Filipinos and Americans were still completely uncertain.</p>

</div>
<p>And now comes some direct evidence. Bray and St. Clair, the latter
the editor of the Insurgent organ in Singapore, were present on the
occasion when independence was said to have been promised by Pratt.
Bray subsequently declared in the most positive terms that it was
promised. St. Clair wrote him a letter taking him roundly to task for
this claim, in the following very interesting terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I felt it to be my duty to let Pratt know that
you still hold that you and Santos have evidence that will controvert
his, (and) he was, of course, extremely disappointed, because he (is)
quite aware of what took place in Spanish, and as to turning of his
conversation into a pretense of agreement he knows nothing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>He says very truly: &lsquo;My own party, the
Democrats, will say if they read this book&mdash;If this man takes it
upon himself to be a Plenipotentiary without authority, we had better
not employ him any more&mdash;I frankly cannot understand your action,
as to its unwisdom I have no doubt at all.<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1665" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Admiral Dewey goes home, it is believed, to advise the
President on Naval and Colonial Affairs, he knows exactly what did take
place and what did not, and I should know if he had any ground to think
that the slightest promise was made by Pratt to Aguinaldo he would
declare it unauthorized and decline to sanction it. I am certain Pratt
reported what he supposed took place accurately; he had no surety on
what you might have said, naturally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, curiously, you never mentioned to me anything of the
agreement as having taken place then, nor in the paper you communicated
to me was there any mention of one, nor did Pratt know of any. It is
only more recently that the fiction took shape. &lsquo;The wish father
to the thought,&rsquo; or the statement repeated till it has become
believed by the&mdash;,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1672src" href=
"#xd26e1672" name="xd26e1672src">32</a> this is common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I would like to urge you, from the practical point of
view, to drop any such foolishness. The vital thing, and nothing else
counts, is what Dewey said and did when he at last met Aguinaldo. That,
that, that, is the thing, all else is empty wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing that Pratt and Wildman had covered inches of paper
with &lsquo;Clauses&rsquo; and put on a ton of sealing wax as consular
seals, what, pray, to any common sense mind would all that have been
worth? Nothing!! Nothing!! And yet, where is the agreement, where is
the seal? Where are there any signatures? And if you had
them&mdash;waste paper&mdash;believe me, that all this potter about
Pratt and Wildman is energy misdirected. The sole thing to have
impressed upon the public in America would be the chaining of Dewey and
Aguinaldo together as participants in common action; you surely
comprehend this means! Think and think again; it means success as far
as it is possible. The other work is not only lost, but does not gain
much sympathy, especially this criticism of the conduct of American
troops; things may be true that are not expedient to say. Sink
everything into Dewey-Aguinaldo co&ouml;peration, that was on both
sides honest even if it did not imply any actual arrangement, which, of
course, Dewey himself could not make. That here you have the
facts,&mdash;undenied&mdash;incontrovertible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=

<p>The following letter of Bray to Aguinaldo, dated January 12, 1899,
seems to me to throw much light on the question of how these claims
relative to the promised recognition of Filipino independence sometimes
originated and were bolstered up:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;With regard to your proclamation, there is
still a trump card to be played. Did you not say that the basis of any
negotiation in Singapore was the Independence of the Philippines under
an American protectorate? This is what Consul Pratt telegraphed and to
which Dewey and Washington agreed; as I figured up the
&lsquo;price&rsquo; of the telegram, I know very well what occurred,
and I am ready to state it and to swear to it when the proper time
comes. There are five of us against one in the event of Consul Pratt
receiving instructions to deny it. Furthermore, Mr. St. Clair knows
what happened and I am certain that he also would testify. St. Clair
still has the rough draft as an historical relic, and St. Clair is a
true and loyal friend of yours, as is your humble
servant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1688src" href="#xd26e1688"
name="xd26e1688src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The utter unscrupulousness of Bray is shown by his claim that St.
Clair would confirm his false statements, made as it was after
receiving St. Clair&rsquo;s letter above quoted.</p>
<p>But Bray did not wait for Aguinaldo to play this trump card. He
tried to play it himself by cabling Senator Hoar, on the same day, that
as the man who introduced General Aguinaldo to the American government
through the consul at Singapore he was prepared to swear that the
conditions under which Aguinaldo promised to cooperate with Dewey were
independence under a protectorate.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1695src"
href="#xd26e1695" name="xd26e1695src">35</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us now trace Aguinaldo&rsquo;s subsequent movements, and see
what promises, if any, were made to him by Wildman and Dewey. He had
returned to Hongkong with two companions, all travelling under assumed
names. Only his most trusted friends among the members of the junta
were at first allowed to know where he was living.</p>
<p>His situation was a difficult one. It was necessary for him to come
to some sort of a temporary arrangement with Artacho, if he was to
avoid legal difficulties, and to re&euml;stablish himself with some of
his companions, who had accused him of deserting with the intention of
going to Europe to live on money which belonged to them. When harmony
had been temporarily restored through the good offices of Sandico,
Aguinaldo had an interview with Consul General Wildman. He has since
claimed that Wildman, too, promised him independence, but the truth
seems to be that he himself said he was anxious to become an American
citizen. This being impossible, he wanted to return to the Philippines
and place himself under Dewey&rsquo;s orders. He wanted to help throw
off the yoke of Spain, and this done, would abide by the decision of
the United States as to the fate of the Philippines.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1724src" href="#xd26e1724" name="xd26e1724src">36</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>Any claim that Aguinaldo had been promised independence by Wildman,
or, indeed, that the latter had been allowed to know that the Filipinos
desired it, seems to me to be negatived, not only by Wildman&rsquo;s
own statements, but by a letter from Agoncillo to Aguinaldo written on
August 5, 1908, in which he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The American consul left my house to-day at 3
o&rsquo;clock, as I had requested an interview with him before his
departure, and I was unable to go to the Consulate on account of the
swelling of my feet. From our conversation I infer that independence
will be given to us. I did not, however, disclose to him our true
desires&#8202;&hellip;. Said consul approved my telegram to McKinley,
which has been sent to-day through him, a copy of which is herewith
enclosed. If they accept our representative in the commission, we may
arrive at a friendly understanding, and it will enable us to prepare
for the fight in case they refuse to listen to our request. On the
other hand, if at the very beginning they refuse to admit our
representative, we will at once be in a position to know what should be
done, <i>i.e.</i> to prepare for war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1736src" href="#xd26e1736" name="xd26e1736src">37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 4, 1898, the Hongkong junta voted that Aguinaldo ought to go
to the Philippines, and go he did. It would seem that he at first gave
up the idea of joining Dewey, for on May 11 he wrote a cipher letter,
giving minute directions for the preparation of signals to assist his
ship in making land, by day or by night, at Dingalan Bay on the east
coast of Luzon; directing the capture of the town of San Antonio, just
back of Capones Islands, in Zambales, and ending with the words:
&ldquo;We will surely arrive at one of the two places above mentioned,
so you must be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something led him again to change his mind, and he finally sailed on
the <i>McCulloch</i>.</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a Ver&iacute;dica&rdquo; written later for
political purposes, Aguinaldo has definitely claimed that Dewey
promised him that the United States would recognize the independence of
the Filipino people. I will let <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>him tell his own story,
confronting his statements with those of the admiral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;May 19, 1898.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>McCulloch</i> started at eleven o&rsquo;clock on the
morning of the 17th of May for the Philippines; we anchored, between
twelve and one o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the 19th, in the
waters of Cavite, and immediately the launch of the Admiral&mdash;with
his aid and private secretary&mdash;came to convey me to the
<i>Olympia</i>, where I was received, with my aid, Sr. Leyva, with the
honors of a general, by a section of marine guards.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1761src" href="#xd26e1761" name=
"xd26e1761src">38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relative to this matter, Admiral Dewey has testified:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1766src" href="#xd26e1766" name=
"xd26e1766src">39</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>The Chairman</i>. You, of course, never
saluted the flag?</p>
<p><i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Certainly not; and I do not think I ever
called Aguinaldo anything but Don Emilio; I don&rsquo;t think I ever
called him &lsquo;General.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>The Chairman</i>. And when he came on board ship was he received
with any special honors at the side?</p>
<p><i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Never.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a Ver&iacute;dica&rdquo;
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Admiral received me in a salon, and after
greetings of courtesy I asked him &lsquo;if all the telegrams relative
to myself which he had addressed to the Consul at Singapore, Mr. Pratt,
were true.&rsquo; He replied in the affirmative, and added, &lsquo;that
the United States had come to the Philippines to protect its natives
and free them from the yoke of Spain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said, moreover, that &lsquo;America was rich in territory and
money, and needed no colonies,&rsquo; concluding by assuring me,
&lsquo;to have no doubt whatever about the recognition of Philippine
independence by the United States.&rsquo; Thereupon he asked me if I
could get the people to arise against the Spaniards and carry on a
rapid campaign.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1796src" href=
"#xd26e1796" name="xd26e1796src">40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have seen, Dewey sent only one telegram to Pratt about
Aguinaldo. It merely directed that the latter be sent. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I then expressed to him my profound
acknowledgment for the generous help which the United States was giving
the Filipino people, as well as my admiration for the magnificence and
goodness of the American people. I also stated to him that
&lsquo;before leaving Hongkong, the Filipino Colony had held a meeting,
at which was discussed and considered the possibility that&mdash;after
defeating the Spaniards&mdash;the Filipinos might have a war with the
Americans, if they should refuse to recognize our independence, who
were sure to defeat us because they should find us tired out, poor in
ammunitions and worn out in the war against the Spaniards,&rsquo;
requesting that he pardon my frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Admiral replied that he &lsquo;was delighted at my
sincerity, and believed that both Filipinos and Americans should treat
each other as allies and friends, clearly explaining all doubts for the
better understanding between both parties,&rsquo; and added that,
&lsquo;so he had been informed, the United States would recognize the
independence of the Filipino people, guaranteed by the word of honor of
the Americans,&mdash;more binding than documents which may remain
unfulfilled when it is desired to fail in them as happened with the
compacts signed by the Spaniards, advising me to form at once a
Filipino national flag, offering in virtue thereof to recognize and
protect it before the other nations, which were represented by the
various squadrons then in the Bay; although he said we should conquer
the power from the Spaniards before floating said flag, so that the act
should be more honourable in the sight of the whole world, and, above
all, before the United States, in order that when the Filipino ships
with their national flag would pass before the foreign squadrons they
should inspire respect and esteem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again I thanked the Admiral for his good advice and generous
offers, informing him that if the sacrifice of my life was necessary to
honor the Admiral before the United States, I was then ready to
sacrifice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I added that under such conditions I could assure him that
all the Filipino people would unite in the revolution to shake off the
yoke of Spain; that it was not strange that some few were not yet on
his side on account of lack of arms or because of personal
expediency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus ended this first conference with Admiral Dewey, to whom
I announced that I would take up my residence at the Naval Headquarters
in the Cavite Arsenal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1813src" href=
"#xd26e1813" name="xd26e1813src">41</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>Further on, in the same document, Aguinaldo advances the claim that
on the occasion of the visit of General Anderson and Admiral Dewey the
latter again promised him independence.</p>
<p>He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In the same month of July, the Admiral,
accompanied by General Anderson, presented himself, and after greetings
of courtesy said to me: &lsquo;You have seen confirmed all of what I
promised and said to you. How pretty your flag is. It has a triangle,
and it looks like Cuba&rsquo;s. Will you give me one as a reminder when
I return to America?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied to him that I was convinced of his word of honour
and that there was no necessity whatever to draw up in documentary form
his agreements, and as for the flag, that he could count on it, even at
that very moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dewey continued: &lsquo;Documents are not complied with when
there is no honour, as has happened with your agreement with the
Spaniards, who have failed in what was written and signed. Trust in my
word for I hold myself responsible that the United States will
recognize the independence of the country. But I recommend to you
[plural.&mdash;TR.] to keep everything which we have talked about and
agreed upon with a great deal of secrecy for the present. And,
moreover, I entreat you [plural.&mdash;TR.] to be patient if our
soldiers should insult some Filipino, because, as volunteers, they are
yet lacking in discipline.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1828src" href="#xd26e1828" name="xd26e1828src">42</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admiral Dewey has testified as follows, concerning the recognition
of Philippine independence by him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>The Chairman</i>. You remember the question
of your recognizing his republic was a good deal discussed and you
wrote me a letter, which I read in the senate. Of course, I am only
asking now about what you said in the letter. There was no recognition
of the republic?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Never. I did not think I had any
authority to do it and it never occurred to me to do it. There was a
sort of a reign of terror; there was no government. These people had
got power for the first time in their lives and they were riding
roughshod over the community. The acts of cruelty which were brought to
my notice were hardly credible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50"
href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>I sent word to Aguinaldo that he
must treat his prisoners kindly, and he said he would.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="figureHead">General Henry W. Lawton</p>
<p class="first">This photograph was taken by the author at General
Lawton&rsquo;s Manila residence, two months before his death.</p>
</div>
<p>He has further testified that he never as much as heard of
independence until the appearance of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s proclamation of
June 15, 1898:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>&hellip;. Then when I heard
that our troops were coming I asked him to withdraw his troops from
Cavite and make room for our men. He demurred at this, but finally
withdrew and established headquarters across the bay at a place called
Bacoor, from which place on the 15th of June he sent me a proclamation
declaring the independence of the Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Chairman</i>. Was that the first?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. That was the first intimation; the
first I had ever heard of independence of the Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Chairman</i>. He had said something to you&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Not a word. He had done what I told
him. He was most obedient; whatever I told him to do he did. I attached
so little importance to this proclamation that I did not even cable its
contents to Washington, but forwarded it through the mails. I never
dreamed that they wanted independence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remembering that Admiral Dewey was not being interrogated as to the
statements of the &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a Veridica,&rdquo; it will be seen
that he has, nevertheless, covered them fully.</p>
<p>It was my good fortune to be long and intimately associated with
Admiral Dewey while serving on the first Philippine commission. He
always grew indignant when the subject of any promises relative to
independence said to have been made by him was so much as mentioned,
and gave to the commission in writing the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The statement of Emilio Aguinaldo, under date
of Sept. 23, published in the <i>Springfield Republican</i>, so far as
it relates to reported conversations with me, or actions of mine, is a
tissue of falsehood. I never, directly or indirectly, promised the
Filipinos independence. I never received Aguinaldo with military
honors, or recognized or saluted the so-called Filipino flag. I never
considered him as an ally, although I did make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>use of
him and the natives to assist me in my operations against the
Spaniards.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1895src" href="#xd26e1895"
name="xd26e1895src">43</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Dewey&rsquo;s allegations flatly contradict those of Aguinaldo,
we must choose between the two. While I have no doubt as to where the
choice will fall, I will now submit some additional matter of interest.
Let us first consider the history of the &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a
Ver&iacute;dica&rdquo; in which Aguinaldo makes the charges above
quoted. On September 12, 1899, Buencamino wrote of it to Apacible in
Hongkong, saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This work is entitled &lsquo;<span lang=
"es">Rese&ntilde;a Ver&iacute;dica de la Revoluci&oacute;n
Filipina</span>&rsquo; in which Don Emilio relates in detail his acts
with Admiral Dewey. It has been distributed to the Consuls and you are
ordered to reprint it there translated into English and send some
copies to the United States, even though only a thousand, if you deem
it advisable. Send copies also to Europe, Se&ntilde;or Agoncillo taking
charge of the publication. If the Agent you may have selected for the
United States should still be there, it would be advisable for him to
take a copy of the pamphlet with him for its publication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an order of the Government which I take pleasure in
transmitting to you for due execution.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1908src" href="#xd26e1908" name="xd26e1908src">44</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there was a change of heart about giving the pamphlet to the
consuls, for under date of September 30 Buencamino wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We have not distributed them here in order that
Otis may not counteract the effects that we desire to produce with this
publication, through his usual machinations. Nor do we believe it
advisable to make this pamphlet public in those colonies before your
arrival in the United States.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1916src" href="#xd26e1916" name="xd26e1916src">45</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this letter he added in cipher the following postscript to Pablo
Ocampo, in charge of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s correspondence in
Manila:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At last moment&mdash;Nota bene:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deliver any copy of the &lsquo;Rese&ntilde;a
Ver&iacute;dica&rsquo; to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>Consuls, even though it was so
directed in the beginning of the letter. All except one, which is for
you, will be sent to Hong-kong, Don Pedro de la Vi&ntilde;a being
bearer of the same, as also of the other documents. The copy intended
for you is neither to be divulged nor published, for strict reserve is
required until those which are being sent arrive at their
destination.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1929src" href=
"#xd26e1929" name="xd26e1929src">46</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for preserving such secrecy relative to this document
until it could reach its destination and work its harm is of course
obvious. Its statements were so outrageously false that they would have
been instantly and authoritatively contradicted had it been issued
seasonably at Manila.</p>
<p>The truth is that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claim that he had been promised
independence was a gradual growth. Let us trace it.</p>
<p>On May 21, he wrote a circular letter to &ldquo;My dear
brother,&rdquo; inviting the recipients and their companions to meet
him at once, and arrange the best way to entrap all the enemy in their
homes.</p>
<p>In this he says that he has promised the American admiral that they
will &ldquo;carry on modern war&rdquo; and adds: &ldquo;Even if a
Spaniard surrenders, he must be pardoned and treated well, and then you
will see that our reputation will be very good in all Europe, which
will declare for our independence; but if we do not conduct ourselves
thus, the Americans will decide to sell us or else divide up our
territory. As they will hold us incapable of governing our land, we
shall not secure our liberty, rather the contrary; our own soil will be
delivered over to other hands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1940src" href="#xd26e1940" name="xd26e1940src">47</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this letter, written on the very day of the interview at which he
subsequently claimed that Admiral Dewey had promised independence, does
he make any claim that this had occurred? No, he very distinctly
implies the contrary. Is it believable that if he could truly have said
&ldquo;The United States, through its representatives Dewey and Pratt,
has promised to recognize our independence&rdquo; he would have failed
to do so when this would instantly have secured him the vigorous
support which he was then uncertain of obtaining? I think not.</p>
<p>In this letter Aguinaldo specifically directs that deceit be
employed and that Spanish officers be treacherously attacked. The
practising of deceit was a carefully considered part of the insurgent
policy. In a letter from Hongkong dated July 21, 1898, Agoncillo writes
as follows to Mabini:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1960src" href=
"#xd26e1960" name="xd26e1960src">48</a>&mdash;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;the time will come when disguises must be set
aside and we will see who is deceiving whom. The statements made by
some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>of the commanders of the fleet here to Don Emilio
and myself were to the effect that the exclusive purpose of the
Government at Washington with regard to the Filipinos, is to grant this
country independence, without any conditions, although I said to myself
that such a purpose was too philanthropical. Don Emilio knew what I
thought then, and I still think the same; that is to say that we are
the ones who must secure the independence of our country by means of
unheard of sacrifices and thus work out its happiness.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1970src" href="#xd26e1970" name=
"xd26e1970src">49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo himself frankly advocated the use of deceit. He practised
what he preached. Simeon Villa, one of his companions on his subsequent
flight through Northern Luzon, before he finally took refuge at
Palanan, kept a diary, which constitutes an official record of this
long journey. In it he has inserted some bits of history of other days,
of which none is more interesting than his account of the beginning of
hostilities against the Spaniards, in August, 1896. From it we learn
that Aguinaldo, who was known to the friar of his town to be both a
mason and a chief of the Katip&uacute;nan, was in danger during August,
and on the night of the 29th of that month called a meeting of all the
compromised persons of the place, who agreed that on the following day
he should &ldquo;make representations to the governor of the
province.&rdquo; Villa says that he was greatly beloved by the governor
and his wife. Early on the following morning, he &ldquo;presented
himself to the governor, and in the name of the people of Cavite Viejo,
offered him their respects and their loyalty to Spain,&rdquo; at the
same time asking a garrison of a hundred men for his town, which the
governor promised to send at once if the captain-general approved.</p>
<p>That afternoon he reported the results of his efforts to his
fellow-conspirators, &ldquo;and told them that then was the opportune
moment for rising against the Spaniards.&rdquo; He initiated the
uprising himself the next morning.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1977src"
href="#xd26e1977" name="xd26e1977src">50</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>Could deceit be more deliberately practised or treachery more
frankly employed? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56"
name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have indulged in this digression to show that Aguinaldo could
hardly have complained had the methods which he used against others
been employed against him. He was never deceived by the Americans, but
his claims relative to independence grew rapidly, and he was soon
deceiving his own people.</p>
<p>On May 24th, he issued no less than four proclamations. One of
these, doubtless intended to be seen by Americans, made no mention of
Independence, but said:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2014src" href=
"#xd26e2014" name="xd26e2014src">51</a>&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The great powerful North American nation has offered its
disinterested protection to secure the liberty of this
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another proclamation, doubtless intended for a different use, he
made the statement that the great North American nation had come to
give decisive and disinterested protection, &ldquo;considering us as
sufficiently civilized and capable of governing
ourselves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2035src" href="#xd26e2035"
name="xd26e2035src">52</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>On June 5, having practically gained control of Cavite Province, he
felt strong enough to announce that independence would be proclaimed on
June 12, and on that date he did proclaim it in a decree.</p>

<p>The Admiral of the American Squadron, with the commanders and
officers of his command, was invited to the ceremonies, but none of
them went. As it was important for Aguinaldo to have some one there to
pose as a representative of the United States, he utilized for this
purpose a certain &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; Johnson, an ex-hotel keeper of
Shanghai, who was running a cinematograph show. He appeared as
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s chief of artillery and the representative of the
North American nation.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2052src" href=
"#xd26e2052" name="xd26e2052src">53</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Even as late as October 3, 1898, Agoncillo in a memorandum addressed
to President McKinley did not claim that independence had been
promised, but said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;As soon as the Spanish-American war began, the
American representatives and officials in Singapore, Hongkong and
Manila, invited the natives of the Philippines to assist the American
arms, which they did gladly and loyally, as allies, with the conviction
that their personality would be recognized, as well as their political,
autonomous and sovereign rights.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2066src" href="#xd26e2066" name="xd26e2066src">54</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>In it he does, however, claim that the organization of a government
independent of America and Spain was accomplished with the tacit
consent of the admiral commanding the fleet and with that of the
general and military and political commanders of the United States of
North America in the Philippines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Who, knowing these facts, not only did not
object but accepted them as a consummated legal act, and maintained
official relations with the new organization, making use thereof in its
subsequent actions and for the subsequent development of the campaign,
which was consequently brought to such a happy end.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2075src" href="#xd26e2075" name=
"xd26e2075src">55</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a second illustration of the stereotyped insurgent procedure
of announcing a policy and then claiming that failure to attack it
meant acquiescence in it. Admiral Dewey says that he did not even read
this proclamation. There was no reason why he should have done so, as
it did not deal with matters which he was authorized to settle. He had
no instructions relative to the recognition of new governments, and he
sent this document to Washington without comment, as he should have
done.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2080src" href="#xd26e2080" name=
"xd26e2080src">56</a></p>
<p>Apropos of this claim that American officers tacitly recognized the
Insurgent government, certain passages from an unsigned document in the
handwriting of Mabini, prepared about July 15, 1898, are of interest.
Mabini, speaking of the attitude of the Americans, says,
&ldquo;Notwithstanding all this and in spite of their protestations of
friendship, they have always refused to recognize that
government.&rdquo; Also, &ldquo;If they persist in refusing to
recognize our government, we shall see ourselves compelled to come to
an agreement with any other government that will consent to recognize
us on friendly terms.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2088src" href=
"#xd26e2088" name="xd26e2088src">57</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>This statement is certainly sufficiently specific as to whether
Americans had recognized the Insurgent government on or before the date
when it was written.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the relations between Aguinaldo and General
Anderson.</p>
<p>Blount attempts to make much of a cablegram, sent by the latter, in
which, after describing the Filipinos, he adds, &ldquo;The people
expect independence.&rdquo; Blount says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;That cablegram of July 22nd, above quoted, in
which the commanding general of our forces in the Philippines advises
the Washington Government, &lsquo;The people expect independence&rsquo;
is the hardest thing in the public archives of our government covering
that momentous period for those who love the memory of Mr. McKinley to
get around. After the war with the Filipinos broke out, McKinley said
repeatedly in public speeches, &lsquo;I never dreamed they would turn
against us.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2111src"
href="#xd26e2111" name="xd26e2111src">58</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is nothing harder than this to get around the memory of
President McKinley will not suffer, as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>important thing is not what Aguinaldo had led his
people to expect, but what the American officials had promised him. The
President was certainly not bound to believe that the Filipinos would
turn against us even if they did then expect independence. Blount has
seen fit to leave unmentioned certain other facts which are very
pertinent in this connection.</p>
<p>Apparently sometime during September, 1898, Sandico made the
following statement in a letter to Aguinaldo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I also have to inform you that Se&ntilde;ores
Basa, Cort&eacute;s and Co. have congratulated the Government of the
United States upon the capture of Manila, stating at the same time that
now that Filipino soil had been soaked with American blood, the Islands
must remain American. I believe that a telegram should be sent
immediately, to counteract that sent by them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2123src" href="#xd26e2123" name="xd26e2123src">59</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably Sandico did not know that on August 15, 1898, Agoncillo had
transmitted another telegram to President McKinley through
Consul-General Wildman, reading as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Agoncillo, my Commissioner and
Ambassador-Extraordinary, representing the provisional government of
the Philippine Islands, in its name and the name of its President,
Emilio Aguinaldo, congratulates you on the successful termination of
the war, and commends the occupancy of Manila. I assure the United
States of the allegiance and unquestioning support of our people, and
petition that we be granted one or more representatives on the
commission that is to decide the future of our Islands.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2131src" href="#xd26e2131" name=
"xd26e2131src">60</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would appear, therefore, that the President had more information
on this subject than was transmitted by General Anderson!</p>
<p>Not only did the latter passively refrain from recognizing
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s pretensions, but on July 22, 1898, he wrote to him as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I observe that your Excellency has announced
yourself Dictator and proclaimed martial law. As I am here simply
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>in a military capacity, I have no authority to
recognize such an assumption. I have no orders from my government on
the subject.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2145src" href=
"#xd26e2145" name="xd26e2145src">61</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effort to keep Americans in ignorance of the true state of
affairs was kept up until further deception was useless. Consul
Williams, for instance, wrote on June 16, 1898:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;For future advantage, I am maintaining cordial
relations with General Aguinaldo, having stipulated submissiveness to
our forces when treating for their return here. Last Sunday, 12th, they
held a council to form provisional government. I was urged to attend,
but thought best to decline. A form of government was adopted, but
General Aguinaldo told me today that his friends all hoped that the
Philippines would be held as a colony of the United States of
America.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2153src" href="#xd26e2153"
name="xd26e2153src">62</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet on Sunday, June 12, Aguinaldo had in reality proclaimed the
independence of the Philippines. Few Americans at this time knew any
Spanish and none understood Tagalog, so that it was comparatively easy
to deceive them. What Consul Williams reported was what Aguinaldo
considered it expedient to have him believe.</p>
<p>The following undated letter from Aguinaldo to Mabini, supposed to
have been sent at this time, is of especial interest in this
connection:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;My dear Brother: I do not want to go there
[where the addressee is] until after the visit of the American Consul,
because I do not wish the negotiations to end in an ultimatum, and in
order that you may tell him all that is favourable for the cause of our
Nation. I charge you with the task of giving him a reply, and if he
should ask about me tell him that since the time of his last visit
there I have not recovered from my illness. If anything important
should happen we can communicate with each other by telegraph, using a
code in matters that require secrecy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2163src" href="#xd26e2163" name="xd26e2163src">63</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter supposed to have been written during November, 1898,
prepared for Aguinaldo&rsquo;s signature and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>addressed to Se&ntilde;or McKinley, President of
the Republic of the United States of North America, but apparently
never sent, Aguinaldo renews the charge<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2170src" href="#xd26e2170" name="xd26e2170src">64</a> previously
made in his &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;ia Ver&iacute;dica,&rdquo; that Pratt
and Dewey promised independence. It need not be further discussed.</p>
<p>The climax was finally reached in an official protest against the
Paris Treaty written by Agoncillo in Paris on the 12th of December,
1898, in which occurs the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The United States of America, on their part,
cannot allege a better right to constitute themselves as arbitrators as
to the future of the Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, the demands of honour and good faith impose
on them the explicit recognition of the political status of the people,
who, loyal to their conventions, were a devoted ally of their forces in
the moments of danger and strife. The noble general Emilio Aguinaldo
and the other Filipino chiefs were solicited to place themselves at the
head of the suffering and heroic sons of that country, to fight against
Spain and to second the action of the brave and skilful Admiral
Dewey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time of employing their armed co&ouml;peration, both
the Commander of the <i>Petrel</i> and Captain Wood in Hongkong, before
the declaration of war, the American Consuls-General Mr. Pratt in
Singapore, Mr. Wildman, in Hongkong, and Mr. Williams in Cavite, acting
as international agents of the great American nation, at a moment of
great anxiety offered to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>recognize the independence of the
Filipino nation, as soon as triumph was obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the faith of such promises, an American man-of-war, the
<i>McCulloch</i> was placed at the disposal of the said leaders and
which took them to their native shores; and Admiral Dewey himself, by
sending the man-of-war; by not denying to General Aguinaldo and his
companions the exacting of his promises, when they were presented to
him on board his flag-ship in the Bay of Manila; by receiving the said
General Aguinaldo before and after his victories and notable deeds of
arms, with the honours due the Commander-in-Chief of an allied army,
and chief of an independent state; by accepting the efficacious
co&ouml;peration of that Army and of those Generals; by recognizing the
Filipino flag, and permitting it to be hoisted on sea and land,
consenting that their ships should sail with the said flag within the
places which were blockaded; by receiving a solemn notification of the
formal proclamation of the Philippine nation, without protesting
against it, nor opposing in any way its existence; by entering into
relations with those Generals and with the national Filipino
authorities recently established, recognized without question the
corporated body and autonomous sovereignty of the people who had just
succeeded in breaking their fetters and freeing themselves by the
impulse of their own force.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2204src"
href="#xd26e2204" name="xd26e2204src">65</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that the claim constantly grows. The commander of
the <i>Petrel</i> Captain Wood, Consul Wildman and Consul Williams are
now included among those alleged to have promised independence, and it
is claimed that Aguinaldo was received with the honours due the chief
of an independent state when he visited Admiral Dewey, whereas his own
original claim was that he was received with the honours due a general,
which is quite a different matter.</p>

</div>
<p>As a matter of fact, American officers usually addressed and treated
Aguinaldo as a general. The extent to which they were able to use his
organization to further the ends of their government will be set forth
later.</p>
<p>In a letter to Wildman, dated August 7, 1898, Aguinaldo admits that
there is no agreement, but says that he cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>tell the
peoples that it does not exist, &ldquo;fearing that I may not be able
to restrain the popular excitement.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2225src" href="#xd26e2225" name="xd26e2225src">66</a> He begs
Wildman to use his influence on his government so that it will realize
the inadvisability of deciding the fate of the people &ldquo;without
considering their will duly represented by my government.&rdquo; Is it
conceivable that, if there had been any ground for claiming a promise
of independence, Aguinaldo would have failed to mention it at this
time?</p>
<p>We may summarize the well-established facts as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Consul-General Pratt was, or professed to be, in hearty sympathy
with the ambition of the Filipino leaders to obtain independence, and
would personally have profited from such a result, but he refrained
from compromising his government and made no promises in its
behalf.</p>
<p>Admiral Dewey never even discussed with Aguinaldo the possibility of
independence.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that any subordinate of the Admiral
ever discussed independence with any Filipino, much less made any
promise concerning it.</p>
<p>Neither Consul Wildman nor Consul Williams promised it, and both
were kept in ignorance of the fact that it was desired up to the last
possible moment.</p>
<p>It is not claimed that either General Anderson or General Merritt
made any promise concerning it.</p>
<p>The conclusion that no such promise was ever made by any of these
men is fully justified by well-established facts.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo himself carefully refrained at the outset from saying, in
any document which Americans could read, that independence had been
promised, and advanced this claim only when the growing strength of his
land force had given him confidence. He repeated it, with increasing
emphasis, as his army increased in size, ultimately openly threatening
war if his pretensions were not recognized. In doing this, he was
merely carrying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>out a carefully prearranged plan, agreed upon by
the Hongkong junta.</p>
<p>And now let us examine the claim that the insurgents were our
&ldquo;faithful allies&rdquo; and &ldquo;co&ouml;perated&rdquo; with us
in the taking of Manila. We shall find that this subject richly repays
investigation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=

&ldquo;Then Aguinaldo had an interview with the United States consul in
Hongkong, in which he told him that he was anxious to become an
American citizen, but this being impossible, he desired to be allowed
to return to the Philippines and place himself under the orders of
Commodore Dewey. According to the brother of that Consul, who certainly
must have had opportunities for knowing the facts in the case, he made
no demands for independence, but said that he hoped that the Americans
would not leave the Filipinos to their fate, but would annex the
Philippines and protect them against the Spaniards. He promised the
Consul that he would fight with the Americans and not attempt to foment
a revolution against the United States. His highest expressed aim was
to throw off the Spanish yoke, and, that once accomplished, he would
abide by the decision of the United States as to the ultimate
disposition of the Philippines. If Aguinaldo had expressed his real
intentions of obtaining arms and using them only for his own purposes,
and, if he found it expedient, against the United States, it is not to
be thought that he would have been returned to the Philippines on a
United States vessel.&rdquo;&mdash;Taylor, 44 F Z.&nbsp;<a class=

<blockquote>
<p class="footnote first">&ldquo;The memorable month of August, 1896,
arrived. Aguinaldo was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55n" href=
"#pb55n" name="pb55n">55</a>]</span>&lsquo;master&rsquo; of the Cavite
Lodge. Moreover, he was a member of the &lsquo;Katip&uacute;nan&rsquo;
Society and the chief of the many members who were in the pueblo of
Cavite Viejo. What was to be done? Aguinaldo, not knowing what to do,
and mindful of the fact that the curate there knew positively that he
was not only a mason, but also the chief of the Katip&uacute;nans of
his pueblo, considered it expedient on the night of August 29 to at
once call a meeting of all the compromised persons in his town.
Aguinaldo made clear to them their grave situation.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;They all agreed that on the following day
Aguinaldo, their chief, should make representations to the Governor of
Cavite; so he went away very early the following morning, presented
himself to the governor, and in the name of the people of Cavite Viejo
offered him their respects and their loyalty to Spain, at the same time
requesting him to condescend to send to his town a garrison of 100 men
for its security. The governor replied that he would first consult the
captain-general, and if the proposition was approved he would send the
garrison at once.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;As Aguinaldo was greatly beloved by the
governor and his wife, they offered him wine and sweetmeats. As soon as
this was over he took his leave and returned happy to his town. On
arrival in the town he assembled all the compromised persons and
informed them of the brilliant result of his efforts. Continuing, he
told them that then was the opportune moment for rising in arms against
the Spaniards. To this they unanimously replied by saying it was
terrible, because no arms were available, and that for this reason it
would certainly prove to be a disaster for them.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;But Aguinaldo, in company with his
godfather, the lamented Candido Tirona, insisted on convincing them
with their strong arguments. They made them understand that Spanish
cruelty would annihilate them without fail, and for no other reason
than that they were members of the Katip&uacute;nan.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;As it happened, at that very time there were
two &lsquo;Guardia Civil&rsquo; soldiers in the court-house. So at
about 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Aguinaldo and Tirona went
directly to the court-house. Arriving there, these two determined
insurgent chiefs intimated to the guards that they should surrender
their equipments. These replied that it was impossible, and said they
would die first. Instantly a struggle ensued between the four men,
which lasted nearly an hour. But it resulted in favor of the insurgent
chiefs who succeeded in taking the guns and cartridges. Once in
possession of these armaments, the two chiefs, accompanied by a number
of the town people, directed themselves to the convent in order to
capture the curate. Very unfortunately for them, the curate was no
longer there when they arrived; he had made his escape. While the
struggle was going on with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56n"
href="#pb56n" name="pb56n">56</a>]</span>guards in the court-house, he
received the news and fled at once by embarking in a native boat.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;The insurgent chiefs then returned to the
court-house and immediately prepared a communication to all the
municipal captains in the provinces of Cavite, Batangas and Laguna,
inviting them to at once rise against Spain, and stating that their own
town of Cavite Viejo was already freed from slavery.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Each one of these communications was sent
out by a mounted courier, so that before the expiration of many hours
all the towns in Cavite Province were informed of what had taken place
in Cavite Viejo.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;On the following day some of the towns took
up arms. At the same time Aguinaldo, in company with many people from
his town, marched on Imus in order to attack the Spanish troops who
were there. When he arrived in Imus the people of this town at once
joined him and they all went to the convent, in which were the friars
and the soldiers of the &lsquo;Guardia Civil.&rsquo; Just as he arrived
at the atrium of the Church his companions did not wish to follow him,
for fear that the soldiers were occupying the church tower. So
Aguinaldo advanced alone until he reached the door of the convent. Once
here, he called his companions to aid him. But these were not so
determined as he was, and only about five responded. When these got to
where Aguinaldo was, he commenced breaking in the door which was soon
open. They went upstairs, but they found nobody, since the friars and
soldiers had crossed over to the treasury building.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Aguinaldo&rsquo;s companions were now
numerous, because the others followed him when they saw that nothing
happened to those who went up into the convent; and all of these went
immediately to the treasury building, in which were the friars and
soldiers whom they were hunting. When they reached it they found the
doors closed, so they could not pass. Aguinaldo ordered the house
burned. Those in hiding inside the house were without any other remedy
and had to surrender; but meanwhile some of them had been burned to
death, among these a lieutenant of the &lsquo;Guardia Civil.&rsquo; By
this victory Aguinaldo succeeded in taking 17 rifles and two 2&frac12;
pounder guns.&rdquo;</p>

itself and whose destructive influence has been one of the causes of

the Philippines exhibiting a cinematograph, kindly consented to appear
on this occasion as Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Chief of Artillery and the
representative of the North American nation. His name does not appear
subsequently among the papers of Aguinaldo. It is possible that his
position as colonel and chief of artillery was a merely temporary one

<p class="first">I have previously<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2257src"
href="#xd26e2257" name="xd26e2257src">1</a> called attention to the
minutes of a session of the Hongkong junta held on May 4, 1898, from
which it indirectly appears that the Filipino leaders at that time
hoped to secure arms at the expense of the Americans and purposed to
attack them later if it seemed advisable.</p>
<p>The treacherous policy then outlined was never departed from by
Aguinaldo and his associates, who sailed for Manila with their eyes
wide open, knowing full well that they had been promised nothing;
prepared to match their wits against those of Admiral Dewey, and intent
on deceiving him and on securing from him arms to be used first against
the Spaniards and later against the Americans, after they had been
employed to help bring about the downfall of Spain.</p>
<p>There exists a significant circular signed &ldquo;J. M.
B.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2265src" href="#xd26e2265" name=
"xd26e2265src">2</a> believed to have been an outright forgery, both
from its tenor and from the fact that the signature &ldquo;J. M.
B.&rdquo; is not in the handwriting of Basa&rsquo;s letter hereinbefore
quoted.</p>
<p>It contains the following statements:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The true patriots have organized a committee to
which I belong, naming Aguinaldo as President and Agoncillo as
Vice-President. The latter and three others have commenced diplomatic
negotiations with the Admiral and American Consul, and we infer that
they are trying to make colonies of us, although they said they would
give us independence. The Committee deemed it advisable to simulate
belief, at the same time equipping ourselves with arms. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We have accepted arms offered by the Admiral which will be
disembarked in the Philippines by the squadron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A part of our forces will aid the Americans by fighting with
them in order to conceal our real intentions, and part will be held in
reserve. If America triumphs and proposes a colony, we shall reject
such offer and rise in arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A separate expedition will disembark at whatever point may be
considered suitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; Alejandrino embarked with the American squadron
in order to give secret instructions to the Chiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be very cautious about this exceedingly delicate point; you
will communicate with prudent and intelligent chiefs who will recognize
the gravity of the subject.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2284src"
href="#xd26e2284" name="xd26e2284src">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, then, in a faked-up letter on which Basa&rsquo;s initials were
forged in order to gain the prestige of his name for this treacherous
plan, we have definitely set forth the purpose of the Filipinos to
deceive the Americans by allowing a part of the Insurgent force to
fight with them, and then to attack them.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to Agoncillo&rsquo;s advice to
Aguinaldo, given under date of August 26, 1898, to the effect that
friendly relations should be maintained with the Americans until the
diplomatic negotiations at Paris should end; that an effort should be
made to find out the future status of the islands &ldquo;by deceitful
means,&rdquo; and that confidence should never be put in the
Americans.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo put the whole matter in a nutshell in a postscript to this
letter, saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;You should issue an order commanding that all
our chiefs should employ a policy of friendship toward the Americans
until our status is defined; but said order should be confidentially
given. Try to mislead them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2296src"
href="#xd26e2296" name="xd26e2296src">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bray also very strongly advised awaiting the results of the Paris
conference.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2301src" href="#xd26e2301" name=
"xd26e2301src">5</a></p>
<p>Blount claims that the Filipinos hoped that the Treaty of Paris
would leave their country to them as it left Cuba to the
Cubans,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2313src" href="#xd26e2313" name=
"xd26e2313src">6</a> and adds that having helped us take the city of
Manila, they &ldquo;felt that they had been &lsquo;given the double
cross,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; &ldquo;believed that the Americans had been
guilty of a duplicity rankly Machiavellian, and that was the cause of
the war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2316src" href="#xd26e2316"
name="xd26e2316src">7</a></p>
<p>The quotations already given from Insurgent records show plainly
that the principal thing for which the Filipinos were waiting was the
ousting of Spain from the Philippines by the United States; those which
follow show that war was by no means inevitable as a result of a a
decision at Paris adverse to Filipino hopes, for the question of
whether a United States protectorate, or even annexation to the United
States, might be considered, was left open to a very late
date.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2324src" href="#xd26e2324" name=
"xd26e2324src">8</a></p>
<p>It has been claimed not only that the Insurgents whipped the
Spaniards without our assistance, but whipped them so thoroughly that
Spanish sovereignty had practically disappeared from the islands at the
time Manila surrendered. It has further been alleged that
&ldquo;decrepit&rdquo; Spain &ldquo;could not possibly have sent any
reinforcements to the Philippines. Besides, the Filipinos would have
&lsquo;eaten them up.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2332src" href="#xd26e2332" name="xd26e2332src">9</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the Filipinos had fought Spain before and were by no means
sanguine. Their more intelligent and reasonable men clearly foresaw
that they could not win unaided. Se&ntilde;or Antonio Regidor was at
the time residing in London. He was a Filipino of unusual intelligence
and exceptionally good education. He took a keen interest in the
situation, and on July 28, 1898, telegraphed Agoncillo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In the name of the Filipinos, you should
immediately send a telegraphic message to MacKinley, requesting him not
to abandon the islands, after having fought as brothers for a common
cause. Pledge him our unconditional adhesion, especially of well-to-do
people. To return to Spain, in whatever form, would mean annihilation,
perpetual anarchy. Filipinos en masse should visit the consuls at
Hongkong, Singapore. London commerce support it. Influence Aguinaldo to
accept American flag, flying it everywhere, thus obliging them to
remain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2343src" href="#xd26e2343"
name="xd26e2343src">10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leaves no room for doubt as to Regidor&rsquo;s views, but
Agoncillo did not share them. He replied on July 29:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Provisional government&rsquo;s aspiration is
independence. Make this campaign.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2351src" href="#xd26e2351" name="xd26e2351src">11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regidor was not to be persuaded. On July 30 he replied as follows,
addressing his communication to Basa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;America vacillating as to remaining fears
conflicts later with natives international question other difficulties
necessary to encourage her all of you submit united unconditionally
raising American flag great demonstrations necessary to influence
outside opinion show islands resolved united America high circles
advise in view present circumstances only feasible programme is
protectorate.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2361src" href=
"#xd26e2361" name="xd26e2361src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Obviously, Agoncillo was somewhat impressed by this cablegram, for
on August 1 in a letter to Aguinaldo he made the following statements
and inquiries:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;If the American troops leave us alone there,
the questions which will arise are these: Have we sufficient arms to
maintain the war against Spain in order to secure our independence? If
the other nations are opposed to our independence and wish that we
should continue under the Spanish sovereignty, have we sufficient
strength to wage a war and obtain victory over Spain and over them in
the future? If you think that we have not sufficient strength to fight
against them, should we accept independence under the American
protectorate? And if so, what conditions or advantages should we give
to the United States? You should carefully consider the preceding
questions, and I suggest that you should, in a confidential manner,
consult them with your cabinet-in-banc, as well as with your private
secretary and military chiefs of rank; and your decision be notified to
our representatives abroad in order that they may know what they must
do in their negotiations. You will see from the telegram addressed to
me by Regidor that he suggests to me to send a message to MacKinley
requesting him not to abandon us, and to submit to them [the U. S.]
unconditionally. As I do not agree with him and as I cannot take any
action which is against the instructions of the government, I replied
to him that the only desire of our government is independence. This may
be seen from the enclosed telegram. On account of this reply, he was, I
think, somewhat offended, as he afterwards sent a telegram to Joviales
[Basa] instead of to me. The latter, upon receiving the telegram,
convened all the boastful patriots, and they adopted a resolution to
send a message to MacKinley requesting annexation. Fortunately, in the
meeting there was present Dr. Justo Lucban, who protested against such
measure. In view of this protest, they again agreed that I should be
present in the meeting, since I am the representative of our
government. At the meeting where I was present, I pointed out the
inadvisability of their resolution, stating, as one of the reasons,
that we should await your instructions in regard to the matter before
sending any message of that character. So the message was not sent; but
I was later informed that Basa had, after all, sent it yesterday,
because he believed that it would not injure our cause. Upon learning
this, I was carried away by passion and went so far as to say to Basa
the following: &lsquo;Many of us, especially myself, think ourselves to
be wise, without being so; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>politicians for what we hear from
others; we claim to be patriots, but we are only so in words; we wish
to be chiefs, but none of us act in a way worthy of a chief.&rsquo; To
this he did not reply. Perhaps his conscience accused him of an act of
treachery, since we agreed in the meeting to await your letter. What
union can you expect from this people?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2374src" href="#xd26e2374" name="xd26e2374src">13</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the Basa here referred to is the man whose initials were
forged on the letter quoted on <a href="#pb67">page 67</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>In the course of the above-mentioned letter Agoncillo came back once
more to the question of independence under a protectorate and made it
very clear that at this late day he did not know whether this was or
was not what the Filipinos desired.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2391src"
href="#xd26e2391" name="xd26e2391src">14</a></p>
<p>On August 21, Apacible obviously did not think that it would be an
easy matter to escape from Spanish domination, much less that the
islands were already rid of it, for he wrote to Mabini that the United
States were likely again to deliver the Filipinos into the hands of
Spain. He said that &ldquo;if events will be what their telegrams
indicate, we have a dark and bloody future before us. To be again in
the hands of Spain will mean a long and bloody war, and it is doubtful
whether the end will be favourable to us&#8202;&hellip; Spain free from
Cuba and her other colonies will employ her energy to crush us and will
send here the 150,000 men she has in Cuba.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2396src" href="#xd26e2396" name="xd26e2396src">15</a> Apacible
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>thought that the best thing was independence under
an American protectorate.</p>
<p>On August 7, 1898, Aguinaldo warned Agoncillo that in the United
States he should &ldquo;not accept any contracts or give any promises
respecting protection or annexation, because we will see first if we
can obtain independence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2405src"
href="#xd26e2405" name="xd26e2405src">16</a></p>
<p>Even annexation to the United States was not excluded by Aguinaldo
from the possible accepted solutions, for in outlining the policy of
the Philippine government to Sandico on August 10, 1898, he
wrote:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The policy of the government is as follows:
1st. To struggle for the independence of &lsquo;the Philippines&rsquo;
as far as our strength and our means will permit. Protection or
annexation will be acceptable only when it can be clearly seen that the
recognition of our Independence, either by force of arms or diplomacy,
is impossible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2418src" href=
"#xd26e2418" name="xd26e2418src">17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 26, 1898, Aguinaldo was still ready to consider annexation
if necessary.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2423src" href="#xd26e2423"
name="xd26e2423src">18</a> He was apparently not sanguine at this time
as to the result of a continued struggle with Spain. At all events, he
wanted the help of the Americans if such a struggle was to come, and
desired to know on what terms it could be had.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2431src" href="#xd26e2431" name="xd26e2431src">19</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Filipinos in Hongkong who favoured annexation made
themselves heard.</p>
<p>On July 18, 1898, Consul-General Wildman wrote from that
place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I believe I know the sentiments of the
political leaders and of the moneyed men among the insurgents, and, in
spite of all statements to the contrary, I know that they are fighting
for annexation to the United States first, and for independence
secondly, if the United States decides to decline the sovereignty of
the Islands. In fact, I have had the most prominent leaders
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>call on me and say they would not raise one finger
unless I could assure them that the United States intended to give them
United States citizenship if they wished it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2446src" href="#xd26e2446" name="xd26e2446src">20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already noted the action of Basa and the Cortez family who
insisted that the Islands must remain American,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2451src" href="#xd26e2451" name="xd26e2451src">21</a> and that of
Agoncillo, who cabled President McKinley in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s name and
his own, congratulating him on the outcome of the war, commending the
occupation of Manila, and assuring the people of the United States of
the allegiance and unquestioning support of the Filipinos,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2457src" href="#xd26e2457" name=
"xd26e2457src">22</a> but it is to be feared that the sending of this
cablegram was only one more move in the Insurgent game of deceit.</p>
<p>There were annexationists in Manila as well as in Hongkong.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2464src" href="#xd26e2464" name=
"xd26e2464src">23</a> Indeed we know that some of the strongest and
best of the Filipinos there were in favour of it.</p>
<p>Felipe Buencamino, writing in 1901, said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In June of 1898, Don Cayetano Arellano<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2478src" href="#xd26e2478" name=
"xd26e2478src">24</a> addressed to Don Felipe Buencamino and Don
Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista a letter written from the town of
Pagsanj&aacute;n, province of Laguna, in reply to one addressed to him
by those two gentlemen. In this letter Don Cayetano outlined the idea
of union with the United States and said: &lsquo;Avoid all doing and
undoing, and when America has established a stable order of affairs,
then it will be time enough to make laws.&rsquo; Mabini, whose
influence at that time was in the ascendant in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
government, paid no heed to this wise advice. In October of 1898, while
the Philippine government was established in Malolos, and before
congress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>had promulgated a Philippine constitution, Messrs.
Arellano and Pardo<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2483src" href=
"#xd26e2483" name="xd26e2483src">25</a> still more earnestly advocated
union with America, the first as secretary of foreign affairs and the
latter as chief diplomat. Their plan consisted in asking the United
States to acknowledge the independence of the country under a
protectorate through the mediation of General Otis, and this plan was
accepted at a cabinet meeting by Don Emilio Aguinaldo. But on the
following day Sandico came and told Aguinaldo that he had had a
conference with the Japanese consul and had been told by him:
&lsquo;that if Aguinaldo would support absolute independence the
Japanese Government would help.&rsquo; Aguinaldo believed
Sandico&rsquo;s story (which turned out to be absolutely false) and did
not carry out the resolution adopted by the cabinet. Messrs. Arellano
and Pardo, after this affront, separated themselves from the Malolos
government. Aguinaldo told me afterwards that he had received a letter
from Agoncillo, dated Washington, assuring him that a majority of the
American people were inclined to acknowledge the independence of the
Philippines and of Cuba.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2486src"
href="#xd26e2486" name="xd26e2486src">26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But annexationists were not confined, in the Philippines, to the
vicinity of Manila.</p>
<p>As late as September 6 Consul Williams reported that a delegation
from four thousand Visayan soldiers, a delegation which also
represented southern business interests, had come to him and pledged
loyalty to annexation.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2493src" href=
"#xd26e2493" name="xd26e2493src">27</a></p>
<p>Clearly, then, the situation early in September was as follows: All
were agreed that the assistance of the United States was necessary in
getting rid of Spanish sovereignty.</p>
<p>Under the plan of Aguinaldo and his followers friendly relations
were to be maintained with the United States, if possible, until Spain
was ousted from her Philippine territory, and then they were to
&ldquo;show their teeth,&rdquo; and see &ldquo;who was deceiving
whom,&rdquo; resorting to &ldquo;force of arms&rdquo; if necessary.
Protection or annexation would be accepted only when it could be
clearly seen that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>recognition of independence, won either by
force of arms or by diplomacy, was impossible.</p>
<p>Other influential and patriotic Filipinos favored annexation to the
United States or a United States protectorate, but their views were in
the end ignored by Aguinaldo and his following, and as the latter had
the guns their ideas prevailed.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Paris, which terminated Spanish sovereignty in the
Philippines, was signed on December 10, 1898. It is important to bear
this date in mind later, when considering the Insurgent records
relative to the preparations which were so carefully made for attacking
the American troops.</p>
<p>And now let us consider the actual facts as to the co&ouml;peration
alleged to have been asked by Americans and given by Filipinos. The
following points are not in dispute:&mdash;</p>
<p>Pratt asked Aguinaldo to co&ouml;perate with Dewey.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo was taken to Manila with the understanding that he would
do so.</p>
<p>Dewey assisted Aguinaldo by destroying the main Spanish fleet; by
bringing him and his associates back to the Philippines; by furnishing
them arms and ammunition; by blockading Manila and by keeping at a safe
distance the Spanish mosquito fleet, which would have made dangerous,
or impossible, the landing of the arms subsequently imported by the
Insurgents.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo successfully attacked the Spanish garrisons in the
provinces and used the arms and ammunition captured, or brought in by
deserters, to equip a force which surrounded and attacked Manila, drove
large numbers of people into the walled city, thus rendering the
position of the Spanish garrison very difficult in the face of a
possible bombardment, and prevented this garrison from betaking itself
to the provinces, as it might otherwise have done, leaving Manila to
shift for itself.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo was powerless to take the place by assault. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>It lay at the mercy of Dewey&rsquo;s guns, and it would have been
possible for the Admiral to take it at any time, but he could not at
first have garrisoned it with United States forces, and never thought
of attempting to use Insurgent forces for this purpose.</p>
<p>Did Dewey really want or need Aguinaldo&rsquo;s help? Let us
consider his testimony on the subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. You did want a man
there who could organize and rouse the people?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I didn&rsquo;t want anybody. I would
like to say now that Aguinaldo and his people were forced on me by
Consul Pratt and Consul Wildman; I didn&rsquo;t do anything&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. Did they have any power to force him
upon you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; they had in a way. They had not
the official power, but one will yield after a while to constant
pressure. I did not expect anything of them; I did not think they would
do anything. I would not have taken them; I did not want them; I did
not believe in them; because, when I left Hongkong, I was led to
suppose that the country was in a state of insurrection, and that at my
first gun, as Mr. Williams put it, there would be a general uprising,
and I thought these half dozen or dozen refugees at Hongkong would play
a very small part in it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2545src"
href="#xd26e2545" name="xd26e2545src">28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The picture of the poor admiral, busy getting his fleet ready for
battle, pestered by officious consuls on the one hand and by
irresponsible Filipinos on the other, is pathetic; but it had its
humorous features, which were not lost on the Admiral himself. I quote
the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Was there any
communication between you and Pratt in which the matter of a written
pledge or agreement with Aguinaldo was discussed with reference to the
Philippine Islands?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. No.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. What became of the correspondence,
Admiral, if you know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. It is all in the Navy Department. When
I turned over my command my official correspondence was all sent to the
Navy Department. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. You retained all
of your letters from any United States officials?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. No; they went to the Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. I mean you did not destroy
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. No; I did not destroy them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. And you turned them over to the
Navy Department?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; our regulations require that. I
may say that for my own information I kept copies of certain telegrams
and cablegrams. I don&rsquo;t think I kept copies of Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s
letters, as I did not consider them of much value. He seemed to be a
sort of busybody there and interfering in other people&rsquo;s business
and I don&rsquo;t think his letters impressed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. He was the consul-general?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; but he had nothing to do with the
attack on Manila, you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. I understand that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I received lots of advice, you
understand, from many irresponsible people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. But Pratt was the consul-general of
the Government there?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; he was consul-general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. And he communicated with you,
giving you such information as he thought you might be interested in,
and among other information he gave you was this concerning
Aguinaldo?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I don&rsquo;t remember; no, I really
don&rsquo;t remember his telling me anything about Aguinaldo more than
that cablegram there, and I said he might come. And you see how much
importance I attached to him; I did not wait for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. What you said was: &lsquo;Tell
Aguinaldo to come as soon as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; but I did not wait a moment for
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Yes; but there was a reason for
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I think more to get rid of him than
anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. Rid of whom?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Of Aguinaldo and the Filipinos. They
were bothering me. I was very busy getting my squadron ready for
battle, and these little men were coming on board my ship at Hongkong
and taking a good deal of my time, and I did not attach the slightest
importance to anything they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=
"#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>could do, and they did nothing; that
is, none of them went with me when I went to Mirs Bay. There had been a
good deal of talk, but when the time came they did not go. One of them
didn&rsquo;t go because he didn&rsquo;t have any toothbrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Burrows</i>. Did he give that as a reason?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; he said, &lsquo;I have no
toothbrush.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2685src"
href="#xd26e2685" name="xd26e2685src">29</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Dewey ultimately yielded to the pressure exercised on him
by Pratt and Wildman, and allowed Aguinaldo and some of his associates
to be brought to Manila. Having them there he proposed to get
assistance from them, not as allies, but as a friendly force attacking
a common enemy, in its own way.</p>

</div>
<p>Let us continue with his testimony as to cooperation between
Aguinaldo and the naval forces of the United States:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Then, Admiral, until
you knew that they were going to send land forces to your assistance
you thought there was a necessity to organize the Filipinos into land
forces, did you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. No; not a necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. You thought it might prove of value
to you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I testified here, I think, in a way
that answers that. I said to Aguinaldo, &lsquo;There is our enemy; now,
you go your way and I will go mine; we had better act
independently.&rsquo; That was the wisest thing I ever said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. But you stated that you were using
these people and they were permitted to organize, that you might use
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. They were assisting us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Very well, they were to assist you.
Did you not either permit them or encourage them&mdash;I do not care
which term you use&mdash;to organize into an army, such as it was, that
they might render you such assistance as you needed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. They were assisting us, but
incidentally they were fighting their enemy; they were fighting an
enemy which had been their enemy for three hundred years. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. I understand
that, Admiral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. While assisting us they were fighting
their own battles, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Chairman</i>. You were encouraging insurrection
against a common enemy with which you were at war?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I think so. I had in my mind an
illustration furnished by the civil war. I was in the South in the
civil war, and the only friends we had in the South were the negroes,
and we made use of them; they assisted us on many occasions. I had that
in mind; I said these people were our friends, and &lsquo;we have come
here and they will help us just exactly as the negroes helped us in the
civil war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. The negroes were expecting their
freedom&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. The Filipinos were slaves, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. What were the Filipinos
expecting?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. They wanted to get rid of the
Spaniards; I do not think they looked much beyond that. I cannot recall
but I have in mind that the one thing they had in their minds was to
get rid of the Spaniards and then to accept us, and that would have
occurred&mdash;I have thought that many times&mdash;if we had had
troops to occupy Manila on the 1st day of May before the insurrection
got started; these people would have accepted us as their friends, and
they would have been our loyal friends&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know for how
long, but they would have been our friends then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. You learned from Pratt, or Wildman,
or Williams, very early, did you not, that the Filipinos wanted their
own country and to rule their own country; that that is what they were
expecting?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I heard from Williams that there was an
insurrection there against the Spaniards. The Spaniards were very cruel
to them, and I think they did not look much beyond getting rid of them.
There was one, Dr. Rizal, who had the idea of independence, but I
don&rsquo;t think that Aguinaldo had much idea of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. Then what useful purpose did the
Filipino army serve; why did you want the Filipino army at all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I did not want them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. Did you not want the Filipino
forces?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. No, not really. It was their own idea
coming over there. We could have taken the city at any moment we had
the troops to occupy it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>Admiral Dewey has made the following statements relative to the
importance of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s military operations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Then he began operations toward Manila, and he
did wonderfully well. He whipped the Spaniards battle after battle, and
finally put one of those old smoothbore guns on a barge, and he wanted
to take this up&mdash;wanted me to tow it up so he could attack the
city with it. I said, &lsquo;Oh, no, no; we can do nothing until our
troops come.&rsquo; I knew he could not take the city without the
assistance of the navy, without my assistance, and I knew that what he
was doing&mdash;driving the Spaniards in&mdash;was saving our own
troops, because our own men perhaps would have had to do that same
thing. He and I were always on the most friendly terms; we had never
had any differences. He considered me as his liberator, as his friend.
I think he had the highest admiration for us because we had whipped the
Spaniards who had been riding them down for three hundred years.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i> (continuing). You sent this short
dispatch to the Secretary of the Navy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Aguinaldo, the revolutionary leader, visited
the <i>Olympia</i> yesterday. He expects to make general attack on May
31. Doubt his ability to succeed. Situation remains
unchanged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recall that visit?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. He came to tell you, did he, that
he was going to make a general attack, and you&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. And you doubted his ability to
succeed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. And he wanted me to assist him. He
wanted me to tow one of his guns up into position. I knew he could not
take the city; of course he could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Did you urge that he should not
make the attack?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I do not remember that; very likely I
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. And was he not persuaded or
restrained by you from doing so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I do not remember; but it is very
likely. I did not want to see a lot of them killed unnecessarily,
because I knew they could not take that walled city. They had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>no artillery, and they could not take it, I knew
very well, and I wanted the situation to remain as it was until our
troops came to occupy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. But you found that whenever you
expressed a strong objection to anything being done at that time that
Aguinaldo yielded to your request?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Up to the time the army came he did
everything I requested. I had not much to do with him after the army
came.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2891src" href="#xd26e2891"
name="xd26e2891src">30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Dewey&rsquo;s influence over Aguinaldo was not sufficient to
prevent his looting, as the following extracts from his testimony
show:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Is that what you mean
when you say he looted&mdash;that he made reprisals for his army, took
provisions and whatever was necessary? That is what you meant?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. That is one part of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. This was taking provisions for the
use of the army?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. That is one thing he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. You said you did not object to that
at the time?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. No. It would have been useless; he got
beyond me very soon&mdash;he got out of my hands very soon.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2927src" href="#xd26e2927" name=
"xd26e2927src">31</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Carmack</i>. You said yesterday you suspected that
Aguinaldo took the lion&rsquo;s share of the provisions that were
gathered for the army. What was the ground upon which you made that
accusation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Because he was living in Malolos like a
prince, like a king, in a way that could only have come about by his
taking the lion&rsquo;s share. Then, in regard to his looting, I repeat
what I said yesterday. He began within forty-eight hours after he
landed in Cavite to capture and take everything he wanted. I know these
things of my own knowledge, because I saw the loot brought in; and I
know that every dollar that was taken from the workingmen at the
navy-yard was taken at the threat of death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2942src" href="#xd26e2942" name="xd26e2942src">32</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Do you believe in this proclamation
he was uttering falsehoods to the Filipino people? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes; I do absolutely. I think he was
there for gain&mdash;for money&mdash;that independence had never up to
that time entered his head. He was there for loot and money. That is
what I believe, since you ask me my belief; I believe that
implicitly.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2960src" href="#xd26e2960" name=
"xd26e2960src">33</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. And you found nothing to cause any
doubt as to his loyalty up to the time until after Manila
surrendered?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. His loyalty to whom?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. To you and to the cause for which
he was fighting?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I began to suspect he was not loyal to
us about the time our troops arrived, when he demurred at moving out of
Cavite to make room for our troops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. Do you mean by that that you feared
that he was commencing to think more of independence than the success
of the American cause?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Yes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2996src" href="#xd26e2996" name="xd26e2996src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen to what extent Aguinaldo co&ouml;perated with the
marine forces of the United States. Now let us examine the claim that
he cooperated with the land forces after their arrival.</p>
<p>One of the things which the Insurgents are said to have accomplished
was the maintenance of an effective land blockade which prevented the
entrance of provisions, and produced a very serious food shortage. Both
Otis and Dewey have stated that they did this, but we learn from the
Insurgent records how erroneous was this conclusion.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3005src" href="#xd26e3005" name="xd26e3005src">35</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>The landing of the American troops for the attack on Manila was not
actively opposed by the Filipinos, but it was narrowly and
distrustfully watched.</p>
<p>Necessary transportation requested by General Anderson was
ultimately furnished by Aguinaldo, but only grudgingly after a three
weeks&rsquo; delay, and as a result of threats that it would be seized
if not voluntarily supplied.</p>
<p>The necessary positions in the trenches around Manila from which to
make the attack on that city were, in part at least, yielded to the
Americans by the Filipinos upon the request of the former.</p>
<p>The Insurgents twice informed the Spaniards in advance of projected
American attacks.</p>
<p>They carried out their own attack on the city without regard to the
plans, or the requests, of the Americans. They secretly treated with
the Spaniards in the endeavour to secure the surrender of the city to
themselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the capitulation to the Americans had been agreed upon, and on
the very morning of the day of the surrender, they endeavoured to push
home an attack. Disregarding the request that they keep out of the
final assault, they crowded into the city with, and after, the American
troops. They fired on Spanish soldiers on the city wall while a flag of
truce was flying, provoking a return fire which killed and wounded
American soldiers.</p>
<p>They demanded for themselves Malaca&ntilde;ang palace and other
buildings and a share in &ldquo;the war booty.&rdquo; They promptly
looted the parts of the city which they occupied, and ultimately
retired from their positions within the city limits on the evening of
their last day of grace after being warned by General Otis that if they
did not do so they would be driven out.</p>
<p>I will now quote from the records in support of these
statements.</p>
<p>The following is the programme of &ldquo;co&ouml;peration&rdquo;
outlined to Aguinaldo by Bray in a letter dated June 30,
1898:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I am very anxious to receive the news of the
capitulation of Manila and I hope that General August&iacute;n will be
obliged to turn over his sword to you in person and not to the
Americans. You are by right entitled to it and I should like to see it
so from a political standpoint, as I am of the opinion that you should
declare the independence of the Philippines before the arrival of
General Merritt, appointed by the President to be Governor with full
powers to establish a provisional government.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Any attempt on the part of the Americans to garrison the interior
towns with their troops or any other act which might be construed as a
conquest, should meet with resistance.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;After having written these lines, I had another conference
with Mr. St. Clair of the Free Press, who sent for me regarding the
question of independence. He has had a consultation with the Supreme
Judge of this place, and he is of opinion that you should proclaim
independence at once, notwithstanding what Admiral Dewey and Consul
Williams say against it, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>this should be done before General
Merritt can arrive. A Government having been thus constituted in due
form, the Americans would have no right to invade the Philippines
without committing a violation of international law. They are no longer
fighting against the Spaniards against whom they declared war. The
advice of Consul Williams to delay this, is a diplomatic play to gain
time until the arrival of General Merritt, because he is well aware of
the false position said General would find himself in. The key to the
situation is now in your hands; do not permit any one to take it away
from you. The Americans have done nothing but bombard and destroy the
Spanish fleet on the high seas; they have not conquered any land, but
in the meantime the control of the Philippines has passed by conquest
from the hands of the Spaniards and the Americans have no right to
enter further. Under certain conditions and guarantees, permit the
landing of American troops; but be very careful, they must not be
permitted to land until they execute an agreement with the duly
constituted government of the Philippines, respecting all its
institutions, and they must under no pretext whatever be permitted to
garrison any place except the municipal limits of Manila, Ceb&uacute;,
and Ilo&iacute;lo, and even therein care should be observed &hellip;
You must not permit a single soldier to land without having these
guarantees.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3051src" href=
"#xd26e3051" name="xd26e3051src">36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When General Anderson, with the first United States troops of
occupation, arrived at Manila Bay, Aguinaldo did not call on him, as an
&ldquo;ally&rdquo; might have been expected to do. Later, however,
Admiral Dewey and General Anderson went to see Aguinaldo, but without
any of the ceremony of an official military call, the Admiral saying to
General Anderson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Do not take your sword or put on your uniform,
but just put on your blouse. Do not go with any
ceremony.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3059src" href="#xd26e3059"
name="xd26e3059src">37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they went in that way.</p>
<p>On July 4, 1898, General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo definitely
requesting his co&ouml;peration in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;For these reasons I desire to have the most
amicable relations with you, and to have you and your force
co&ouml;perate with us in the military operations against the Spanish
forces.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3069src" href="#xd26e3069"
name="xd26e3069src">38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>On July 5 Aguinaldo replied, thanking General Anderson for the</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;amicable sentiments which the natives of these
islands inspire in the Great North American nation,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3078src" href="#xd26e3078" name=
"xd26e3078src">39</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figure p013width" id="p013"><img src="images/p013.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">Governor-general James F. Smith with a Bontoc
Igorot Escort</p>
<p class="first">Up to the time of Governor-general Smith, no
governor-general had ever penetrated the land of the Luzon
head-hunters. He crossed Bontoc and Ifugao, in company with the author,
in 1907. This photograph shows him on the crewst of the Polis range, at
the boundary line between these two sub-provinces, sixty-four hundred
feet above the sea.</p>
</div>
<p>and also for his desire to have friendly relations with the
Filipinos and treat them with justice, courtesy and kindness. There is,
however, not a word relative to co&ouml;peration in his reply, and
Anderson apparently never renewed his request for co&ouml;peration in
military operations.</p>
<p>On July 6 he wrote to Aguinaldo again, saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I am encouraged by the friendly sentiment
expressed by Your Excellency in your welcome letter received on the 5th
instant, to endeavour to come to a definite understanding, which I hope
will be advantageous to both. Very soon we expect large additional land
forces, and it must be apparent to you as a military officer that we
will require much more room to camp our soldiers and also store room
for our supplies. For this I would like to have Your Excellency&rsquo;s
advice and co&ouml;peration, as you are best acquainted with the
resources of the country.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3096src"
href="#xd26e3096" name="xd26e3096src">40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this letter there was no reply. However, in a letter dated July
9, 1898, to the Adjutant-General of the United States Army, General
Anderson says of Aguinaldo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;When we first landed he seemed very suspicious,
and not at all friendly, but I have now come to a better understanding
with him and he is much more friendly and seems willing to
co&ouml;perate. But he has declared himself Dictator and President, and
is trying to take Manila without our assistance. This is not probable,
but if he can effect his purpose he will, I apprehend, antagonize any
attempt on our part to establish a provisional
government.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3104src" href=
"#xd26e3104" name="xd26e3104src">41</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently, however, co&ouml;peration, even in the matter of getting
necessary transportation, did not materialize, for on July 17 S. R.
Jones, Chief Quartermaster, wrote Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We will want horses, buffaloes, carts, etc.,
for transportation, bamboo for shelter, wood to cook with, etc. For all
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>we are willing to pay a fair price, but no more.
We find so far that the native population are not willing to give us
this assistance as promptly as required. But we must have it, and if it
becomes necessary we will be compelled to send out parties to seize
what we may need. We would regret very much to do this, as we are here
to befriend the Filipinos. Our nation has spent millions in money to
send forces here to expel the Spaniards and to give good government to
the whole people, and the return we are asking is comparatively
slight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Anderson wishes you to inform your people that we are
here for their good, and that they must supply us with labor and
material at the current market prices. We are prepared to purchase five
hundred horses at a fair price, but cannot undertake to bargain for
horses with each individual owner.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo sent this letter by a staff officer to General Anderson
inquiring whether it was sent by authority of the latter, who then
indorsed on it in a statement that it was. Nevertheless, Major Jones
reported on July 20 that it was impossible to secure transportation
except upon Aguinaldo&rsquo;s order and that the natives had removed
their cart wheels and hidden them, from which it is to be inferred that
the transportation requested had not been furnished.</p>
<p>Obviously General Anderson was informed that Aguinaldo had given
orders against furnishing the transportation desired, for on July 21 he
wrote the Adjutant-General of the Army as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Since I wrote last, Aguinaldo has put in
operation an elaborate system of military government, under his assumed
authority as Dictator, and has prohibited any supplies being given us,
except by his order. As Go this last, I have written to him that our
requisitions on the country for horses, ox carts, fuel, and bamboo (to
make scaling ladders) must be filled, and that he must aid in having
them filled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 23 General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">General</span>: When I came
here three weeks ago I requested Your Excellency to give what
assistance you could to procure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>means of transportation for the
American Army, as it was to fight the cause of your people. So far we
have received no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you represent your people, I now have the honor to make
requisition on you for five hundred horses and fifty oxen and ox carts.
If you cannot secure these I will have to pass you and make requisition
directly on the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg leave to request an answer at your earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain with great respect, etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3142src" href="#xd26e3142" name="xd26e3142src">42</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this letter, Aguinaldo replied as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Replying to your letter of yesterday, I have
the honor to manifest to Your Excellency that I am surprised beyond
measure at that which you say to me in it, lamenting the non-receipt of
any response relative to the assistance that you have asked of me in
the way of horses, carabaos, and carts, because I did reply through the
bearer that I was disposed to issue proper orders whenever you advised
me of the number of these, giving me notice in advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent orders to the nearest provinces in order that
within the shortest time possible horses be brought for sale, but I
cannot assure Your Excellency that we will have the number of 500 that
you need, because there are not many horses in this vicinity, owing to
deaths from epizo&ouml;tic diseases in January, February, and March
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever we have them collected, I shall have the pleasure to
advise Your Excellency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have also ordered to be placed at my disposal 50 carts that
I shall place at your disposition when you need them, provided you give
me previous notice four days in advance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3156src" href="#xd26e3156" name="xd26e3156src">43</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Anderson replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Your favour of the 26th ultimo in relation to
requisitions for cattle, horses, etc., is satisfactory I regret that
there should have been any misunderstanding about it. The people to
whom we applied even for the hiring of carromatas, etc., told our
people that they had orders to supply nothing except by your orders. I
am pleased to think that this was a misapprehension on their
part.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3166src" href="#xd26e3166"
name="xd26e3166src">44</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this series of communications it appears that it took three
weeks, and a very direct threat to seize transportation, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>to bring
about Aguinaldo&rsquo;s promise of assistance in securing it. What help
had he given, meanwhile, in other matters?</p>
<p>On July 14, 1899, General Anderson wrote asking him to assist
American officers in making reconnaissance of the approaches to Manila,
and to favor them with his advice.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3177src"
href="#xd26e3177" name="xd26e3177src">45</a></p>
<p>On July 19, 1899, he again wrote Aguinaldo asking him to allow Major
J. F. Bell,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3182src" href="#xd26e3182" name=
"xd26e3182src">46</a> who was gathering information for General
Merritt, to see maps, and further requesting him to place at
Bell&rsquo;s disposal any available information about the force of the
enemy and the topography of the country.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3185src" href="#xd26e3185" name="xd26e3185src">47</a></p>
<p>On July 21 he wrote again asking for passes for a Lieutenant E. I.
Bryan and party, who were making a reconnaissance.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3191src" href="#xd26e3191" name="xd26e3191src">48</a></p>
<p>Such records as I have been able to find do not show what response,
if any, Aguinaldo made to these several requests, but General
Anderson&rsquo;s original views as to the willingness of the Insurgents
to co&ouml;perate with him underwent an early change, for on July 18,
1898, in a letter to the Adjutant-General of the United States Army he
makes the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Insurgent chief, Aguinaldo, has declared
himself Dictator and self-appointed President. He has declared martial
law and promulgated a minute method of rule and administration under
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have observed all official military courtesies, and he and
his followers express great admiration and gratitude to the great
American republic of the north, yet in many ways they obstruct our
purposes and are using every effort to take Manila without us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect also that Aguinaldo is secretly negotiating with
the Spanish authorities, as his confidential aide is in
Manila.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3204src" href="#xd26e3204"
name="xd26e3204src">49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suspicion was entirely justified, as we shall see later.</p>
<p>On July 24 Aguinaldo wrote a letter to General Anderson in effect
warning him not to disembark American <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>troops in places
conquered by the Filipinos from the Spaniards without first
communicating in writing the places to be occupied and the object of
the occupation.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3214src" href="#xd26e3214"
name="xd26e3214src">50</a></p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s assumption of civil authority on July 15, 1899,
did not pass unnoticed. On July 21 General Anderson wrote the
Adjutant-General of the army concerning it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;His assumption of civil authority I have
ignored, and let him know verbally that I could, and would, not
recognize it, while I did not recognize him as a military leader. It
may seem strange that I have made no formal protest against his
proclamation as Dictator, his declaration of martial law, and
publication and execution of a despotic form of government. I wrote
such a protest, but did not publish it, at Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s
request, and also for fear of wounding the susceptibilities of
Major-General Merritt, but I have let it be known in every other way
that we do not recognize the Dictatorship. These people only respect
force and firmness. I submit, with all deference, that we have
heretofore underrated the natives. They are not ignorant, savage
tribes, but have a civilization of their own; and although
insignificant in appearance, are fierce fighters, and for a tropical
people they are industrious. A small detail of natives will do more
work in a given time than a regiment of volunteers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>Because he was invited as general rather than as president,
Aguinaldo refused to attend a parade and review on the 4th of July.
This fact is, in itself, an answer to his claim that the Americans were
tacitly recognizing his pretensions.</p>
<p>After referring to this incident, Blount says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On subsequent anniversaries of the day in the
Philippines it was deemed wise simply to prohibit the reading of our
declaration before gatherings of the Filipino people. It saved
discussion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3234src" href=
"#xd26e3234" name="xd26e3234src">51</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is incorrect. I myself was present the following year
when the declaration was read on the Luneta to a considerable gathering
of Filipinos among whom were many school children, and it has often
been read since.</p>
<p>The landing of American troops at Para&ntilde;aque and their going
into camp near that town on July 15 caused much excitement, and a
lively interchange of telegrams between Insurgent officers
followed.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3241src" href="#xd26e3241" name=
"xd26e3241src">52</a></p>
<p>They were suspicious of the intentions of the Americans,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3253src" href="#xd26e3253" name=
"xd26e3253src">53</a> and trouble soon began.</p>
<p>On July 16 General Noriel telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;An American has come here who says that he is a
Colonel of the Army whom we should obey; and that it is your desire. We
did not listen to him, awaiting your order.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the back of the telegram is written the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Reply.&mdash;You should not obey. What this
American Colonel says is a lie. Be cautious so as not to be deceived.
You should require from him proof. Be always vigilant, but upright,
also all of the officers and soldiers must be strict and not
timid.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3272src" href="#xd26e3272"
name="xd26e3272src">54</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously there was no real co&ouml;peration between American and
Filipino troops at this time. General Anderson ignored General
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s request for information as to places where American
troops were to land in Filipino territory and the objects of
disembarking them.</p>
<p>The Americans proceeded with their plans for the attack upon Manila,
and it became desirable to occupy some of the Insurgent trenches. On
July 29 Ar&eacute;valo telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In conference with General Greene I asked for
an official letter, a copy of which I send you: &lsquo;Headquarters 2nd
Brigade, U. S. Expeditionary Forces, Camp Dewey, near Manila, July
29th, 1898. <span class="sc">El Se&ntilde;or Noriel, General de
Brigade</span>. Sir: In pursuance of our conversation of yesterday and
the message which Captain Ar&eacute;valo brought to me during the
night, I beg to inform you that my troops will occupy the intrenchments
between the Camino Real and the beach, leaving camp for that purpose at
8.00 o&rsquo;clock this morning. I will be obliged if you will give the
necessary orders for the withdrawal of your men. Thanking you for your
courtesy, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
<span class="sc">F. V. Greene, Brigadier General</span>,
commanding.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3288src"
href="#xd26e3288" name="xd26e3288src">55</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clear direct declaration of intention by General Greene is the
actual transaction referred to by Blount as &ldquo;Jockeying the
Insurgents out of their trenches.&rdquo; He bases his statements
concerning the matter on a newspaper report. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>The attitude of the army officers in the matter of obtaining
permission to occupy the trenches needed in preparing for the assault
on the city could not have been more correct.</p>
<p>On August 10 General Merritt gave the following emphatic
instructions relative to the matter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;No rupture with Insurgents. This is imperative.
Can ask Insurgent generals or Aguinaldo for permission to occupy their
trenches, but if refused not to use force.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same day General Anderson wrote to Aguinaldo, asking
permission to occupy a trench facing blockhouse No. 14, in order to
place artillery to destroy it. The permission was granted on the
following day.</p>
<p>During the early part of August, Aguinaldo seems to have avoided
conferences with American officers. On the second of the month Mabini
wrote him how he had put off Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s aid with a false
statement that he did not know Aguinaldo&rsquo;s whereabouts.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3306src" href="#xd26e3306" name=
"xd26e3306src">56</a></p>
<p>The landing of American troops at Para&ntilde;aque for the assault
on Manila led to the concentration of Insurgent troops at the
neighbouring town of Bacoor.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3311src" href=
"#xd26e3311" name="xd26e3311src">57</a></p>
<p>On August 8 Fernando Acevedo<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3319src"
href="#xd26e3319" name="xd26e3319src">58</a> wrote to General
P&iacute;o <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>del Pilar that the Americans were going to attack
the next day and that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is requisite and necessary before their
attack takes place to-morrow, that you to-morrow or to-night annihilate
them, sparing none, for the way they have deceived us, and will again
without fail, in the contract signed by Sr. Emilio; and convince
yourself, my friend, that it is necessary to do this; and when it is
done the whole world will wonder and say that we have done well, and
will not be able to give out that the people here are fools spending
the time sucking their fingers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Worse yet, information was sent to the Spaniards of the proposed
American attack on the 13th instant, as is shown by the following
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;(Battalion of Cazadores, No. 2. Expeditionary.

name="xd26e3366src">61</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Taylor, this was not the first occurrence of this sort.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The officers of the United States Army who
believed that the insurgents were informing the Spaniards of the
American movements were right. Sastr&oacute;n has printed a letter from
P&iacute;o del Pilar, dated July 30, to the Spanish officer commanding
at Santa Ana, in which Pilar said that Aguinaldo had told him that the
Americans would attack the Spanish lines on August 2 and advised that
the Spaniards should not give way, but hold their positions. Pilar
added, however, that if the Spaniards should fall back on the walled
city and surrender Santa Ana to himself, he would hold it with his own
men. Aguinaldo&rsquo;s information was correct, and on August 2 eight
American soldiers were killed or wounded by the Spanish
fire.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3374src" href="#xd26e3374"
name="xd26e3374src">62</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taylor continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;And yet Aguinaldo claimed to be an ally of the
Americans. It is not probable that these were the only two such letters
written. Aguinaldo had by this time found out that although he could
defeat the scattered Spanish detachments, he could not defeat the
Spanish force holding the lines of Manila. He did not want the
Americans in the Philippines. They were in his way, and he had already
made up his mind that if they did not give him what he wanted, he would
drive them out by force. He saw very early that it was extremely
improbable that he should obtain from them what he wanted; accordingly
all losses both among Spaniards and Americans would, from
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s point of view, inure to his benefit. The best
possible thing for him would be to hold his own force intact while they
wore each other out. The Spanish losses, small as they were, occurred
in front of the American lines, not in front of the Filipinos. There is
no reason, accordingly, for believing that the Filipinos suffered
heavily. To arrange that the Spaniards should inflict losses upon the
Americans, while he saved his own men, showed ingenuity on the part of
Aguinaldo; but it was decidedly not the conduct of an
ally.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3383src" href="#xd26e3383"
name="xd26e3383src">63</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feeling toward the American troops at this time is further shown
by a telegram from General P&iacute;o del Pilar, sent from San Pedro
Macati on August 10, 1898:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Commandant Acebedo writes that the Spaniards
are about to surrender because they want to turn over the place; the
Americans want them to leave only the batteries and say that they will
station themselves in said batteries. It appears that they want to
deceive us; they do not want to give us arms, and if they do not give
us arms, we shall attack them and drive them out. I await your
reply.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3391src" href="#xd26e3391"
name="xd26e3391src">64</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps not quite the kind of co&ouml;peration that Admiral
Dewey and Generals Anderson and Merritt had expected.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Insurgents were determined to capture Manila
for themselves, not only because of the &ldquo;war booty,&rdquo; for
which they were hungry, but because of the status which they felt that
the taking of the capital <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>of the Philippines would assure them.
The great importance which they attached to this plan is shown in
communications written by Agoncillo, Aguinaldo and others.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3400src" href="#xd26e3400" name=
"xd26e3400src">65</a></p>
<p>Of conditions at this time, Taylor says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On July 7, Aguinaldo appointed Artemio Ricarte
and Pantale&oacute;n Garc&iacute;a to negotiate the surrender of Manila
by the Spaniards to him (Exhibit 155). On July 5 Pantale&oacute;n
Garc&iacute;a was planning to enter Manila by way of Tondo or of Santa
Cruz (P.I.R., 243.7). On the 9th Aguinaldo ordered that rice should be
gathered from the towns of Manila Province for the use of his troops in
the decisive attack upon Manila which he intended making in a few days
(P.I.R., 1087. 5).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aguinaldo, finding that his chance of obtaining Manila for
himself was growing steadily less, now determined to force himself into
the city with the Americans and demand a consideration for the
assistance he had rendered them during the siege. It is true he had
assisted them, but his assistance had not been intentional. It was the
result of the operations he was carrying on for his own ends. The
operations of the Filipinos and the Americans were against Spain as a
common enemy of both; but the operations were not joint operations, and
although their purpose was a common purpose, it was not a mutual one.
On August 8 Aguinaldo appointed General <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>Ricarte commander in the
operations about Manila, ordered him to respect the property of all
foreigners, and told him that in case his troops succeeded in entering
Manila they were to carry their flag and plant it there (P.I.R., 703.
2). Judging from an unsigned draft of a letter, he must have warned the
foreign consuls in Manila about the same time to gather under the
protection of their flags all of their fellow-citizens who had not
taken refuge on the vessels in the bay, so that when his troops entered
the city no foreign lives would be taken, and no foreign property would
be injured. The earnestness with which he urged that all foreigners not
Spaniards should take steps to identify themselves and their property
shows that he considered the persons and property of Spanish civilians
as fair booty of war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3421src" href=
"#xd26e3421" name="xd26e3421src">66</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was certainly no need of Insurgent assistance in the assault
on Manila.</p>
<p>The reports which reached Aguinaldo that the surrender of Manila had
been agreed upon in advance were correct, as is shown by the following
testimony of Admiral Dewey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. When did you reach an
understanding with the Spanish commander upon the subject,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3434src" href="#xd26e3434" name=
"xd26e3434src">67</a>&mdash;how long before the 12th or 13th of
August?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. Several days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. To whom did you communicate the
arrangement that you had?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. General Merritt and, of course, all of
my own captains&mdash;General Merritt, and I think a council of
officers on board of one of the steamers. I think there were several
army officers present when I told the General that; and I may say here
that I do not think General Merritt took much stock in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Senator Patterson</i>. What statement did you make to
them, Admiral, in substance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. That the Spaniards were ready to
surrender, but before doing so I must engage one of the outlying forts.
I selected one at Malate, away from the city.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3462src" href="#xd26e3462" name="xd26e3462src">68</a> They said I
must engage that and fire for a while, and then I was to make a signal
by the international code, &lsquo;Do you surrender?&rsquo; Then they
were to hoist a white flag at a certain bastion; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>I
may say now that I was the first one to discover the white flag. We had
50 people looking for that white flag, but I happened to be the first
one who saw it. I fired for a while, and then made the signal according
to the programme. We could not see the white flag&mdash;it was rather a
thick day&mdash;but finally I discovered it on the south bastion; I
don&rsquo;t know how long it had been flying there when I first saw
it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3467src" href="#xd26e3467" name=
"xd26e3467src">69</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 12, the day before Manila surrendered, Buencamino
telegraphed Aguinaldo, urging him in the strongest terms to attack that
night so that Americans might be obliged to ask him to stop, with the
result that the Insurgents would be included in the official
negotiations. He further advised Aguinaldo that he must not suspend his
attack because the Americans suspended theirs.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3472src" href="#xd26e3472" name="xd26e3472src">70</a></p>
<p>General Anderson tells us that, on the evening of August 12, he
received an order from General Merritt to notify Aguinaldo to forbid
the Insurgents under his command from entering Manila. This
notification was delivered to Aguinaldo that night, and was received by
him with anger.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3480src" href="#xd26e3480"
name="xd26e3480src">71</a></p>
<p>On the following morning the Insurgents actually made an independent
attack of their own, as planned.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3489src"
href="#xd26e3489" name="xd26e3489src">72</a> It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>promptly led to trouble with the Americans, and
at 8 A.M. Aguinaldo received a telegram from General Anderson sternly
warning him not to let his troops enter Manila without the consent of
the American commander on the south side of the Pasig River.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3499src" href="#xd26e3499" name=
"xd26e3499src">73</a></p>
<p>Aguinaldo apparently took no action in response to this request,
except to direct General Riego de Dios, who was at Cavite, to go with
Buencamino without losing a moment and ask for an explanation, in
writing if possible.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3517src" href=
"#xd26e3517" name="xd26e3517src">74</a></p>
<p>At 10.50 A.M. he telegraphed General Anderson saying that his troops
were being forced, by threats of violence, to retire from positions
which they had taken, and asking Anderson to order his troops to avoid
difficulty with the Insurgent forces. Aguinaldo said that he had
directed his men to aid the American forces if the latter are attacked
by a common enemy, but was discreetly silent on the subject of their
entering Manila.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3525src" href="#xd26e3525"
name="xd26e3525src">75</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, at 11.05, he received a reply to his telegram
to General Riego de Dios, in which that officer communicated the views
of Araneta<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3533src" href="#xd26e3533" name=
"xd26e3533src">76</a> and Buencamino, who had been unable to find
General Anderson. This important communication follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. Araneta and Buencamino having been
consulted in regard to your telegram of to-day, they confirm
capitulation, and in regard to the telegraphic note of General Anderson
they are of the opinion, first that we should continue hostilities
while we ask for an explanation; second, that explanation should be in
the following terms: Inquire reason for note and ask why our troops are
not to enter Manila without permission of the American commander;
third, in case the (terms of?) capitulation is given as the reason, to
answer that we do not suspend our attempt to enter Manila. Its
capitulation is not favourable to our independence. General Anderson is
not here. General Merritt is probably in Manila. Only Admiral Dewey is
in the Bay. We ask authorization to express our explanation in the
proposed terms and to have a conference with Admiral Dewey in order to
have our claims reach General Merritt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3539src" href="#xd26e3539" name="xd26e3539src">77</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An endorsement written by Mabini and signed by Aguinaldo on the
above paper reads:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I authorize every assertion of right, but state
that we believe that we have the right to enter Manila without
permission as we have a part in the surrender of the Spaniards. They
would not have surrendered if our troops had not cut off their retreat
to the interior. Besides but for us the landing of troops would have
cost them much blood. Obtain an answer as soon as possible in order to
lay a protest before the consuls in case it is
necessary.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3547src" href="#xd26e3547"
name="xd26e3547src">78</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>Naturally, trouble followed. At 1.30 P.M. General Ricarte
telegraphed to Aguinaldo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Americans wish to put us out. Give
directions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3558src" href=
"#xd26e3558" name="xd26e3558src">79</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently about the same hour he wired more at length, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. American troops rearguard our
trenches. Mabolo and San Jos&eacute; warn us that they will fire on us
when the time comes. Impossible to remain there without disagreeing
with them. Since 5 o&rsquo;clock this morning we have been furiously
attacking. Americans firing incessantly, Spaniards silent. No losses
yet.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3566src" href="#xd26e3566" name=
"xd26e3566src">80</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 3.52 he wired again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;General P&iacute;o del Pilar informs me of the
following: &lsquo;Come here, if possible, as our soldiers at the barrio
of Concepci&oacute;n are not allowed to go out and we are prohibited to
move on any farther. We it was who succeeded in capturing that place.
Come here or there will be trouble, since they are driving me away, and
refusing to listen to what I say.&rsquo; I am at this very moment going
to aforesaid place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3576src" href=
"#xd26e3576" name="xd26e3576src">81</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 5 P.M. another was sent by Ricarte to Aguinaldo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Colonel San Miguel arrived here from Ermita.
Regional Exposition, Agricultural College and other buildings are ours.
Our flag flies already at Ermita. Colonel Agapito Donz&oacute;n with
his troops is in the P&eacute;rez building, Paco. Colonels Julian

"xd26e3586src" href="#xd26e3586" name="xd26e3586src">82</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 6.15 P.M. he telegraphed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I inform you that the chiefs of our troops have
reported to me that our flag at Singalong church (<i>visita</i>) was

us to approach thereto. General P&iacute;o del Pilar is at present at
the barrio of Concepci&oacute;n. Americans prohibited him to move on
any farther. How can he enter Manila?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>No attention was paid to General Anderson&rsquo;s request that the
Insurgent troops should not enter Manila without permission. They
crowded forward with and after the American forces. Coming out on
Bagumbayan drive, they found American and Spanish troops confronting
each other but not firing, the former on the drive, the latter on the
neighbouring city wall. A flag of truce was waving from the south
bastion, nevertheless the Insurgents fired on the Spanish forces,
provoking a return fire which killed and wounded American soldiers. Of
this incident General Greene has said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At this point the California regiment a short
time before had met some insurgents who had fired at the Spaniards on
the walls, and the latter, in returning the fire, had caused a loss in
the California regiment of 1 killed and 2 wounded.&rdquo;<a class=

</div>
<p>Some of these matters must have come to the attention of General
Anderson, for he sent Aguinaldo a telegram, received by the latter at
6.35 P.M., as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Dated Ermita Headquarters 2nd Division 13 to
Gen. Aguinaldo. Commanding Filipino Forces.&mdash;Manila, taken.
Serious trouble threatened between our forces. Try and prevent it. Your
troops should not force themselves in the city until we have received
the full surrender then we will negotiate with you.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It appears that the Insurgent troops took the suburb of Santa Ana,
and captured Spanish and Filipino officers and men.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3636src" href="#xd26e3636" name="xd26e3636src">86</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=

<p>In view of the known facts, how absurd becomes the following
contention of Aguinaldo, advanced in his &ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a
Ver&iacute;dica:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Our own forces could see the American forces
land on the beach of the Luneta and of the Paseo de Santa Luc&iacute;a.
The Spanish soldiers, who were on the walls of the city, drew the
attention of every one because they did not fire on the former, a
mystery which was explained at nightfall of that day, by the news of
the capitulation of the place by General Se&ntilde;or
J&aacute;udenes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3651src" href="#xd26e3651"
name="xd26e3651src">87</a> to the American General, Mr. Merritt, a
capitulation which the American Generals claimed for themselves, an
infraction of what had been agreed upon with Admiral Dewey, in regard
to the formation of plans for the attack and taking of Manila by the
two armies, American and Filipino, together and in combination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This inexplicable line of conduct on the part of the American
officers was made clearer by the telegrams, which General Anderson
addressed to me, from Maytubig on the said 13th day, requesting that I
should order our troops not to enter Manila, which request was refused,
inasmuch as it was contrary to what was agreed upon, and to the high
ends of the Revolutionary Government, which, on taking upon itself the
immense work of besieging Manila, during the two months and a half,
sacrificing thousands of lives and millions in material interests,
could not surely have done so with any object other than that of
capturing Manila and the Spanish garrison which with firmness and
tenacity defended that place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3656src" href="#xd26e3656" name="xd26e3656src">88</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 14 Aguinaldo telegraphed General Anderson as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;My troops, who have been for so long besieging
Manila, have always been promised that they could appear in it, as you
know and cannot deny, and for this reason, and on account of the many
sacrifices made of money, and lives, I do not consider it prudent to
issue orders to the contrary, as they might be disobeyed against my
authority. Besides, I hope that you will allow the troops to enter
because we have given proofs many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>times of our friendship,
ceding our positions at Para&ntilde;aque, Pasay, Sing&aacute;lon and
Maytubig. Nevertheless, if it seems best to you, and in order to enter
into a frank and friendly understanding and avoid any disagreeable
conflict before the eyes of the Spaniards, I will commission Don Felipe
Buencamino and others, who will to-day go out from our lines and hold a
conference with you, and that they will be safe during the
conference.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3666src" href=
"#xd26e3666" name="xd26e3666src">89</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo and his associates pressed the demand for joint
occupation. On August 13 Admiral Dewey and General Merritt informed the
government that since the occupation of Manila and its suburbs the
Insurgents outside had been insisting on this, and asked how far they
might proceed in enforcing obedience in the matter.</p>
<p>They were informed by a telegram dated August 17 that the President
of the United States had directed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;That there must be no joint occupation with the
Insurgents. The United States in the possession of Manila city, Manila
bay and harbor must preserve the peace and protect persons and property
within the territory occupied by their military and naval forces. The
insurgents and all others must recognize the military occupation and
authority of the United States and the cessation of hostilities
proclaimed by the President. Use whatever means in your judgment are
necessary to this end.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3676src" href=
"#xd26e3676" name="xd26e3676src">90</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This left the military and naval commanders no option in the
premises, and in any event dual occupation was out of the question
because of the lawlessness of the Insurgent troops.</p>
<p>At this very time they were looting the portions of the city which
they occupied, and as is abundantly shown by their own records were not
confining their attacks to Spaniards, but were assaulting their own
people and raiding the property of foreigners as well.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3685src" href="#xd26e3685" name=
"xd26e3685src">91</a> The continuation of such a condition of affairs
was manifestly impossible.</p>
<p>The Insurgents promptly demanded their share in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>&ldquo;war booty,&rdquo; and asked certain other
extraordinary concessions as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;(4) Our sacrifices in co&ouml;perating in the
siege and taking of Manila being well known, it is just that we should
share in the war booty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(5) We demand for our use the palace of Malaca&ntilde;ang and
the Convents of Malate, Ermita and Paco or San Fernando de Dilao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(6) We demand that the civil offices of Manila be filled by
North Americans and never by Spaniards; but if General Merritt should
require some Filipinos we should be pleased if he will grant our
President, Don Emilio Aguinaldo, the favour of recommending select and
skilled Filipinos. The jurisdiction of the authorities of Manila shall
not be recognized beyond the municipal radius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(7) The American forces shall not approach nor penetrate our
military positions without permission of the respective commanders
thereof and shall evacuate all the positions which they occupy at the
present time beyond the municipal radius; Spaniards who pass our lines
without permission of the commander will be considered as spies.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;(10) Lastly we state clearly that our concessions and
petitions do not signify on our part that we recognize the sovereignty
of North America in these islands, as they are made necessary by the
present war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3708src" href=
"#xd26e3708" name="xd26e3708src">92</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the instructions of the President these demands could not be
acceded to. Nor could they have been acceded to had there been no such
instructions. In this connection the following extract from General
J&aacute;udenes&rsquo;s cablegram for June 8th to his home government
is highly significant:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Population of suburbs have taken refuge in
walled city from fear of outrages of insurgents, preferring to run
risks of bombardment, which has not yet begun.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3716src" href="#xd26e3716" name="xd26e3716src">93</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would seem that the population of the suburbs did not have a high
idea of Insurgent discipline. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108"
href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>That their apprehensions were not groundless is shown by a passage
in a letter sent the following day to Governor-General Augustin by
Buencamino:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Manila being surrounded by land and by sea,
without hope of assistance from anywhere, and Se&ntilde;or Aguinaldo
being disposed to make use of the fleet in order to bombard, if Your
Excellency should prolong the struggle with tenacity, I do not know,
frankly, what else to do other than to succumb dying, but Your
Excellency knows that the entrance of 100,000 Indians,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3728src" href="#xd26e3728" name=
"xd26e3728src">94</a> inflamed with battle, drunk with triumph and with
blood, will produce the hecatomb from which there will not be allowed
to escape either women, children, or Peninsular
friars,&mdash;especially the friars; and, I believe that the rights of
humanity, imperilled in such a serious way, should be well considered
by Your Excellency, for however dear glory and military duty may be,
although worth as much or more than existence itself there is no right
by which they should be won at the cost of the rights of humanity, and
the latter outweigh every consideration and all duty.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3734src" href="#xd26e3734" name=
"xd26e3734src">95</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don Felipe knew his own people. He also knew, none better, what they
had in mind at this time.</p>
<p>As it was the Insurgent forces made the most of such opportunity as
they had, and their own records show it.</p>
<p>In the suburbs of Manila they sacked and committed outrages,
threatening people with their arms, and this was still going on a week
after the fall of Manila.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3743src" href=
"#xd26e3743" name="xd26e3743src">96</a></p>
<p>General P&iacute;o del Pilar was believed to be responsible for much
of this misconduct, and Mabini proposed that as it was necessary for
him to leave the vicinity of Manila, and they could not remove him by
force, he be promoted.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3751src" href=
"#xd26e3751" name="xd26e3751src">97</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time during this month Sandico wrote Aguinaldo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Americans have already heard of the
frequent cases of kidnapping (<i>dukut</i>) occurring in Tondo, San
Sebasti&aacute;n and San Miguel. Last night some of ours were surprised
in the act of kidnapping a person. I have also heard that many persons
are asking for contributions of war. I tell them<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3774src" href="#xd26e3774" name="xd26e3774src">98</a> that you
know nothing of all this and that if some persons are kidnapped it is
due to the hate of the natives for the Spanish spies and secret police,
which is great.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3779src" href=
"#xd26e3779" name="xd26e3779src">99</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently Sandico continued to interest himself in the matter of
preventing disorder, for on September 24, 1898, he wrote Aguinaldo from
Manila as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;By authority of General Don P&iacute;o del
Pilar and accompanied by the War Auditor, Se&ntilde;or Urbano, we
entered a prison where the individuals Mariano de la Cruz and Mariano
Cris&oacute;stomo were kept. They were almost prostrated. They had
lately been released from Bilibid where they had been confined for
political crimes. On being asked the reason for their imprisonment they
began by showing us their bodies from which blood still issued as the
result of the barbarous treatment received from Major Carmona who, by
the way, is the same person of whom I spoke to you in one of my
previous letters; I declared to you then that he had assaulted,
revolver in hand, a man in the middle of one of the most frequented
streets of the suburb of Paco on pure suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prisoners in question stated that if they admitted the
accusations made against them it was for fear of greater punishments
promised by said Major. The officer of the guard took <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>the
liberty of striking with his fist the one who dared to express himself
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before such a spectacle Major Bell found himself forced to
tell them that brutal acts are not precisely a recommendation for a
country that wished to be free and that they, the Americans, do not
arrest any one without just cause.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3793src"
href="#xd26e3793" name="xd26e3793src">100</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I take the liberty of calling your attention to the matter in
question and other abuses in order that the measures you may think fit
be adopted to remedy this evil. In fact, we are making a target of
ourselves in the sight of all nations, especially so in that of the
Americans who note any act of ours and judge us secretly now in order
to do so later in public. To make light of this is to plant a seed of
future injury to us, because many will desire to place themselves under
the protection of the American flag, seeing that ours refuses to defend
the citizens&rsquo; individual rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, for my part, ask that Major Carmona be arrested together
with his accomplices in the matter so that it may serve as a lesson not
only for him but also for those who think like him.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3800src" href="#xd26e3800" name=
"xd26e3800src">101</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously Sandico&rsquo;s protest of September 24 did not produce
the desired result, for on September 28 he wrote Aguinaldo a long
letter complaining that in Manila personal security did not exist,
people were being tortured and murdered, kidnapping and theft were very
frequent, and these abuses were being committed by Filipino officers
and men. Some of the things which had come to his knowledge were of
such a nature that he preferred to speak to Aguinaldo privately about
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3805src" href="#xd26e3805" name=
"xd26e3805src">102</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>Murder, pillaging, torture of prisoners, kidnapping,
theft&mdash;these are not pleasant things, but they continued to occur,
and Aguinaldo, who apparently desired to prevent them, was powerless to
do so. He did not dare discipline General P&iacute;o del Pilar, nor
remove him from the vicinity of Manila, and the soldiers of that
officer continued to work their will on their own unfortunate and
helpless people.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo at first flatly refused to direct the disorderly Insurgent
forces to leave Manila. The American commander showed great forbearance
and negotiations continued.</p>
<p>On August 16, 1898, the Diplomatic Commission (Buencamino and
Gregorio Araneta) telegraphed Aguinaldo <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>that a clause in a
proposed agreement requiring prior permission of Insurgent officers
before American troops could pass or approach their lines had greatly
displeased General Anderson who declined to treat until after the
withdrawal of Noriel&rsquo;s troops from Manila.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3837src" href="#xd26e3837" name="xd26e3837src">103</a></p>

<p class="figureHead">An Unsanitary Well</p>

<p class="first">There is no way in which the water from such a well
can become infected. More than eight hundred fifty have been sunk, and
the death rate in some towns fortunate enough to possess them has
fallen off fifty per cent, as a result.</p>
</div>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s reply, sent on August 17, 1898, shows that he had
already made up his mind to fight the Americans, for it contains the
following significant words: &ldquo;The conflict is coming sooner or
later and we shall gain nothing by asking as favours of them what are
really our rights.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3856src" href=
"#xd26e3856" name="xd26e3856src">104</a></p>
<p>While negotiations were pending General Merritt sent Major J. F.
Bell to Aguinaldo with a letter and also with a memorandum in which
were the words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In case you find Aguinaldo inclined to be
generous in his arrangements with us, you may communicate to him as
follows: &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There follow six paragraphs, of which the third is of special
importance. It reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;(3) That I have every disposition to represent
liberally the Government at Washington, which I know is inclined to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>deal fairly with him and his people; but not
knowing what the policy of that Government will be, I am not prepared
to make any promises, except that in the event of the United States
withdrawing from these islands care will be taken to leave him <i>in as
good condition as he was found by the forces of the
Government</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3875src" href="#xd26e3875"
name="xd26e3875src">105</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relative to the italicized portion of this statement Major Bell
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I was pressed to explain further just what
meaning General M. meant to convey by the underscored portion of this
remark, but I replied that I had repeated the language General M. had
used to me, and I preferred they should seek any further explanation
from him, lest I might unwittingly fall into error if I undertook to
explain his meaning myself. Their lack of definiteness and my
unwillingness to comment upon the language seemed to arouse their
apprehensions and suspicions. They have been trying ever since to
obtain in writing some definite promise on this
subject.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3883src" href="#xd26e3883"
name="xd26e3883src">106</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo ordered that the machinery of the water works be started
up at once, a thing which was very necessary as Manila was suffering
from lack of water. I should be glad if I could leave this matter here,
but I cannot, for Major Bell elsewhere makes the further
statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Attention is invited to General Merritt&rsquo;s
promise made known to Aguinaldo by me verbally, namely, that in the
event of the United States withdrawing from these islands, care would
be taken to leave Aguinaldo in as good condition as he was found by the
forces of the Government. From a remark the General made to me I
inferred he intended to interpret the expression &lsquo;forces of the
Government&rsquo; to mean the naval forces, should future contingencies
necessitate such an interpretation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3893src" href="#xd26e3893" name="xd26e3893src">107</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us hope that Major Bell misunderstood General Merritt&rsquo;s
intention. If this is not the case, I must say in all frankness that in
my opinion it was General Merritt&rsquo;s intention to indulge in sharp
practice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>Obviously, the American naval forces did not find Aguinaldo in any
&ldquo;condition,&rdquo; in the sense in which General Merritt uses the
term. On the contrary, they brought him from Hongkong and assisted him
in starting a revolution. The negotiations in question were relative to
the positions held by the Insurgents at the time the negotiations took
place, and General Merritt&rsquo;s promise could not legitimately be
interpreted to refer to anything else.</p>
<p>Had Aguinaldo accepted his offer, a most embarrassing situation
would have resulted. General Merritt was obviously not authorized to
make such a proposition in the first instance, and the only honourable
course left open to him would have been to advise Washington of his
improper action and beg the Government to support him in it and thus
save the honour of the country.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Aguinaldo did not act upon the promise nor accept the
offer. On the contrary, he promptly and indignantly denied that he was
committed to anything, and sought to impose new conditions which were
not acceded to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some one doubtless got hold of General Merritt and called
his attention to the fact that in making this offer he had grossly
exceeded his authority, for in his reply to Aguinaldo&rsquo;s protest
General Merritt says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;So far as any promises as to what should be
done in the event of a conclusion of a treaty between the United States
and Spain are concerned, it is utterly impossible for me as the
military representative only of the United States to make any promises
such as you request. As you have already been informed, you may depend
upon the good will of the Americans out here and the Government, of
which you already know the beneficence, to determine these matters in
the future.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3913src" href=
"#xd26e3913" name="xd26e3913src">108</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming, as this statement did, after the offer made in the
memorandum hereinbefore referred to, it must have aroused the
suspicions of Aguinaldo and his associates, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>and
in my opinion Merritt&rsquo;s conduct in making such a proposal in the
first instance was inexcusable.</p>
<p>Before he could terminate the negotiations which followed he was
called away, and turned this matter, together with other unfinished
business, over to his successor, General E. S. Otis.</p>
<p>On August 31, 1898, the latter official wrote to Aguinaldo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">General Aguinaldo,
Bacoor</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring to promise made by General Merritt to reply to your
letter of August 27 within four days, I desire to state that he was
unexpectedly ordered away and had not opportunity to reply. Being
unacquainted with the situation, I must take time to inform myself
before answering, which I will do at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Otis</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 8 General Otis wrote Aguinaldo a long letter fully
discussing the whole situation in the light of the complete information
which he had meanwhile obtained. Since so much has been made of this
incident by Blount and others, I invite attention to the following
extracts from General Otis&rsquo;s letter, which embody a fair and
judicial statement of the conditions which existed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;You designate certain lines within the suburbs
of the city of Manila, to which you promise to retire your troops, and
name as conditions precedent: First, protection to your shipping by the
United States Navy, and the free navigation of your vessels within the
waters in United States occupation; second, restitution to your forces
of all positions which are now occupied by your troops, in the event
that treaty stipulations between the United States and Spain surrender
to the last-named government the territory occupied by the former; and
thirdly, that United States troops now occupying positions beyond the
lines you name shall retire within the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A discussion of your proposition to hold, jointly, with the
United States Government, the city of Manila, involves consideration of
some of the other concessions you desire to be made, and to that I will
at once refer. I wish to present the matter, in the first instance, in
its legal aspect, although, from remarks contained in former
correspondence, I am of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>opinion that you are fully aware
how untenable the proposition is. The United States and Spain were and
are belligerent parties to a war, and were so recognized by the
civilized world. In the course of events the entire city of Manila,
then in full possession of Spanish forces, was surrendered to the
first-named belligerent power. The articles of agreement and
capitulation gave the United States Government full occupancy of the
city and defences of Manila, and that Government obligated itself to
insure the safety of the lives and property of the inhabitants of the
city to the best of its ability. By all the laws of war and all
international precedents the United States authority over Manila and
its defences is full and supreme, and it cannot escape the obligations
which it has assumed.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;But conceding, as you do, the strictly legal right of my
Government to hold and administer the affairs of the city of Manila and
its suburbs (I thus conclude from expressions contained in former
correspondence and from my appreciation of your intellectual
attainments), you base your proposition&mdash;a joint
occupation&mdash;upon supposed equitable grounds, referring to the
sacrifices your troops have made and the assistance they have rendered
the American forces in the capture of Manila. It is well known they
have made personal sacrifices, endured great hardships, and have
rendered aid. But is it forgotten that my Government has swept the
Spanish navy from the seas of both hemispheres; sent back to Spain the
Spanish army and navy forces, recently embarked for your destruction,
and the secure holding of the Philippine possessions; that since May 1
last its navy has held the city of Manila at its mercy, but out of
consideration of humanity refused to bombard it, preferring to send
troops to demand surrender, and thereby preserve the lives and property
of the inhabitants? Is it forgotten that the destruction of the Spanish
navy and the retention of Spanish armed men in its European possessions
has opened up to you the ports of the Island of Luzon and held Spain
helpless to meet its refractory subjects?</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Apart from all legal and equitable considerations, and those
having their origin in personally conceived ideas of justice, I wish
respectfully to call your attention to the impracticability of
maintaining a joint occupation of Manila and its suburbs, and in this I
know that I shall have the approval of your excellent judgment. It
would be extremely difficult to prevent friction between our respective
forces, which might <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>result in unfortunate consequences, labor
as we may for continued harmonious relations. Located in close
proximity, irresponsible members of our organizations, by careless or
impertinent action, might be the means of inciting grave disturbances;
and in this connection I call to your attention the recent shooting
affair at Cavite, which still requires investigation. There might also
arise conflict of authority between our subordinate officers. Even now,
within precincts in entire actual possession of our troops, I find that
permits are given to citizens, who are styled local presidents, to make
arrests, to carry arms, etc., in violation of our instructions and
authority, and that several cases of kidnapping have taken place. In
pursuance of our obligations to maintain, in so far as we can, domestic
tranquillity, our officers have arrested suspected parties, and they
have asserted (with what element of truth I know not) that the
insurgent forces are the offenders. I have declined to accept their
statements, as I prefer to believe the contrary, although it would
appear that officers connected with those forces have issued the
permits to which I allude. Such interference with our administration of
civil affairs must eventually result in conflict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; And here permit me to remark upon a view of the
subject you have advocated in support of the plea for dual occupation
of the city&rsquo;s suburbs. Your forces, you say in substance, should
have a share in the booty resulting from the conquest of the city, on
account of hardships endured and assistance rendered. The facts on
which you base your conclusion granted, your conclusion, under the
rules of war which are binding on my Government, does not follow, for
it has never recognized the existence of spoils of war, denominated
&lsquo;booty,&rsquo; as have many European governments. No
enemy&rsquo;s property of any kind, public or private, can be seized,
claimed by, or awarded to, any of its officers or men, and should they
attempt to appropriate any of it for their individual benefit, they
would be very severely punished through military tribunals, on which
have been conferred by law very sweeping jurisdiction. The
enemy&rsquo;s money and property (all that is not necessary to be
expended in administering local affairs in the enemy&rsquo;s territory)
must be preserved for final arbitrament or settlement by and between
the supreme authorities of the nations concerned. My troops cannot
acquire booty nor any individual benefit by reason of the capture of an
enemy&rsquo;s territory. I make this comment, believing that you hold
erroneous opinions in respect to individual advantages which occupation
bestows. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I request your indulgence while I briefly consider the
concessions you ask us to make as conditions precedent to the
retirement of your forces to the lines indicated by your note of the
27th ultimo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first is: Protection to your shipping and free navigation
to your vessels. Neither the extent of protection nor the limit of free
navigation you request is understood. Certainly you could not mean
protection on the high seas, or in the ports not in the rightful
possession of the United States. That, as you are fully aware, could
only be effected by treaty, or guarantee, following international
recognition of the belligerent rights of the Philippine revolutionary
government. While the existing armistice continues, the United States
are in rightful possession, in so far as the navigable waters of the
Philippine Islands are concerned, only of the bay of Manila and its
navigable tributaries. Within the same all vessels of trade and
commerce and the war vessels of recognized national powers sail freely
as long as the sovereignty of my Government is not assailed nor the
peace of the locality threatened. In this respect, whatever concessions
are extended by way of relaxation of trade restrictions, incident to
war, to the citizens of these islands will be extended to all alike,
and discrimination in this regard is neither intended nor permitted.
Admiral Dewey exercises supervision over all naval matters, and they
are in no way related to the duties conferred upon me by law. Nor would
it avail should I seek his consent for greater latitude of action, for
even if disposed to grant special concessions he could not do so, and I
doubt if the supreme authority of my Government could now, under the
prevailing truce with Spain, invest him with the requisite powers to do
so and at the same time preserve its international obligations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second concession named by you is restitution of
positions in the city of Manila to your forces, in case the treaty of
peace remands to Spain the territory surrendered under the late
capitulatory articles; and the third and last is a promise to retire
our troops within the lines indicated by you, as the lines on which you
desire your troops to remain permanently. These propositions, having a
kindred nature, may be considered together, and, indeed, have already
been impliedly answered. From previous statements of facts and logical
conclusions made and stated in this communication, concerning the
nature of the obligations resting on the United States with regard to
the territory to which they have the legal right of possession under
contracting articles with Spain, it is evident that neither
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>in law or morals can the concessions be made. I
would be powerless to grant them in any aspect of the case, being
nothing more than an agent to carry out the instructions of the
executive head of my Government and not being vested with discretionary
power to determine matters of such moment. In the present instance I am
not only powerless to accede to your request, but have been strictly
enjoined by my Government, mindful of its international promises and
national honour, which it has never broken nor sacrificed, not to
accede joint occupation of the city and suburbs of Manila and am
directed specially to preserve the peace and protect persons and
property within the territory surrendered under the terms of the
Spanish capitulation. These mandates must be obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus have I endeavoured with all candor and sincerity,
holding nothing in reserve, to place before you the situation as
understood by me, and I doubt not by the Republic which I represent. I
have not been instructed as to what policy the United States intends to
pursue in regard to its legitimate holdings here, and hence I am unable
to give you any information on the subject. That it will have a care
and labor conscientiously for the welfare of your people I sincerely
believe. It remains for you, beneficiaries of its sacrifices, to adopt
a course of action which will manifest your good intentions and show to
the world the principles which actuate your proceedings.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;It only remains for me to respectfully notify you that I am
compelled by my instructions to direct that your armed forces evacuate
the entire city of Manila, including its suburbs and defences, and that
I shall be obliged to take action with that end in view within a very
short space of time should you decline to comply with my
Government&rsquo;s demands; and I hereby serve notice on you that
unless your troops are withdrawn beyond the line of the city&rsquo;s
defences before Thursday, the 15th instant, I shall be obliged to
resort to forcible action, and that my Government will hold you
responsible for any unfortunate consequences which may ensue.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;In conclusion, I beg to inform you that I have conferred
freely with Admiral Dewey upon the contents of this communication and
am delegated by him to state that he fully approves of the same in all
respects; that the commands of our Government compel us to act as
herein indicated, and that between our respective forces there will be
unanimity and complete concert of action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This calm and temperate discussion of the situation, coupled with
the firm statement of intention with which it closed, produced a
decided effect on Aguinaldo. Concerning the events to which it led,
General Otis has made this statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On September 13, a commission sent by Aguinaldo
and consisting of three members, one of whom was the treasurer and
another the attorney-general of the insurgent government, called for
the purpose of discussing the subject of my letter of the 8th. They
asked me to withdraw it and simply request in writing that the
insurgent troops retire to the line designated by General Merritt,
which I refused to do, stating that unless they withdrew as directed we
would be obliged to resort to force. They then asked that I withdraw
the letter and issue a request unaccompanied by any threat to use
force, as Aguinaldo was fearful that he would be unable to remove his
troops upon a demand. To which I replied that the letter of the 8th
instant would stand. They then said that as the demands of that letter
must remain unchanged, the insurgents would withdraw as directed
therein, but that if I would express in writing a simple request to
Aguinaldo to withdraw to the lines which I designated&mdash;something
which he could show to the troops and induce them to think that he was
simply acting upon a request from these headquarters&mdash;he would
probably be able to retire his men without much difficulty; that, of
course, they themselves understood the direction to withdraw, which
would be obeyed, and thereupon repeated their desire to obtain a note
of request, whereupon I furnished them with the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

September 13, 1898.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">The Commanding General of the
Philippine Forces</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">Sir</span>: Referring to my
communication of September 8, I have the honour to inform you that I
have had a most agreeable conversation with certain gentlemen who are
in the interests of your revolutionary government upon the matters
therein contained. We have discussed at length the complications now
existing, which will exist, and will doubtless increase, while our
troops continue to occupy jointly certain districts of the city of
Manila. I have urged upon them the necessity of the withdrawal of your
troops in order that the friendly relations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>which have always been maintained by and between
them and the forces of the United States Government may be perpetuated.
I am sure that the gentlemen fully appreciate my sentiments and will
clearly report them to you. May I ask you to patiently listen to their
report of our conversation?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;It is my desire that our friendly intercourse
and mutual amicable relations be continued; that they be not
jeopardized if we can by consistent action avoid it, and such, I am
certain, is the desire of yourself and associates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;May I ask, therefore, that you withdraw your
troops from Manila?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Permit me to add in conclusion that I have that
confidence in your ability and patriotism which will lead you to accede
to this request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I am, with great respect, your most obedient
servant,</p>
<p>(Signed) &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">E. S.

<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Major-General, U. S. V.,</p>

<p>&ldquo;In reply to which, on the 16th, the following was
received:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">Malolos,

<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">The Commanding General of the
American Forces</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">My Dear Sir</span>: Referring
to your esteemed communication, dated the 13th instant, I have the
honour to inform you that I have given appropriate orders that my
troops should abandon their most advanced positions within some of the
suburbs, and that they should retire to points where contact with yours
would be more difficult, in order to avoid all occasion for
conflict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I hope that by these presents you will be fully
convinced of my constant desire to preserve amicable relations with the
American forces, even at the risk of sacrificing a part of the
confidence placed in my government by the Philippine people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;A consideration of my many occupations will
serve to excuse me for not having answered with the promptness
desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Your very respectful servant,</p>
<p>(Signed) &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">Emilio
Aguinaldo</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On the evening of the 15th the armed insurgent organizations
withdrew from the city and all of its suburbs, as acknowledged by their
leaders, excepting from one small outlying district. This certain
agents of Aguinaldo asked on the previous day to be permitted to retain
for a short time, on the plea that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>general officer in
command<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4073src" href="#xd26e4073" name=
"xd26e4073src">109</a> would not obey instructions, and they proposed
to remove his men gradually by organizations and thereafter to punish
him for his disobedience. The withdrawal was effected adroitly, as the
insurgents marched out in excellent spirits, cheering the American
troops.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4076src" href="#xd26e4076"
name="xd26e4076src">110</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have given the facts thus fully for the reason that this is the
one instance I have found in which a promise was made, fortunately in
the form of an offer which was not accepted, and then withdrawn. It has
seemed to me that the reasons why General Merritt should never have
made it, and why General Otis could not possibly have renewed it,
should be fully set forth.</p>
<p>On September 7, 1898, General Otis had cabled to Washington that
Admiral Dewey and he considered conditions critical, and that the
number of armed Insurgents in the city was large and rapidly
increasing. He stated that on the 8th he would send a notification to
Aguinaldo that unless the latter&rsquo;s troops were withdrawn beyond
the line of the suburbs of the cry before September 15 he would be
obliged to resort to forcible action and that the United States would
hold Aguinaldo responsible for any unfortunate consequences which might
ensue.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo still hoped to obtain recognition of his government by the
United States, but did not consider such recognition probable, and
pushed preparations to attack if a favorable opportunity should
offer.</p>
<p>Before occupying ourselves with these preparations, let us briefly
review the results of our investigations as to Insurgent
co&ouml;peration with the American forces up to this time.</p>
<p>Taylor has made the following excellent summary of the
case:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Up to this time Aguinaldo had continued a
desultory warfare with the Spanish troops in Manila. That none of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>attacks were very serious is shown from the
Spanish reports of casualties; but although he had failed to secure the
surrender of the city to himself, he had kept its garrison occupied and
within their works. The American force on land was now strong enough to
begin offensive operations. So far the relations between the Americans
and Aguinaldo had not been really friendly. They were in his way, and
yet he could not break with them, for he hoped to use them for the
attainment of the designs which he had by this time frankly declared.
The Americans had listened to these declarations, and had not answered
them, nor was it possible to answer them. The American forces were
there under the instructions of the President to make war on Spain and
to establish a military government in the Philippines. Aguinaldo had
declared himself a dictator and the Philippines independent. To have
recognized him in his civil capacity, to have dealt with him in his
civil capacity, would have meant a recognition of his government by the
military commander in the field&mdash;a thing impossible and unlawful.
Officers of the United States forces are not empowered to recognize
governments; that function is reserved to the President of the United
States; and in this case he, in his orders to the Secretary of War,
dated May 19, copies of which were forwarded to General Merritt for his
guidance, informed him that the army of occupation was sent to the
Philippines &lsquo;for the twofold purpose of completing the reduction
of the Spanish power in that quarter and of giving order and security
to the islands while in the possession of the United States.&rsquo;
These instructions contemplated the establishment of a military
government in the archipelago by military officials of the United
States.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;it is true that in spite of the date of these instructions
General Merritt in San Francisco had received no copy of them on August
28, three days after the departure of General Anderson, and what that
officer knew of them could only have been what General Merritt
remembered of the contents of an unsigned copy of them shown him at the
White House, but they were in accordance with the practice of the
United States Government in occupying conquered territory, that
practice General Anderson well knew, and his relations with Aguinaldo
were guided by it.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;It has been claimed that Aguinaldo and his followers received
the impression at this time from their conversation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>with
American officers that the United States would undoubtedly recognize
the independence of the Philippines, and that the cooperation of the
insurgents was due to this impression. There was no cooperation. That
he attempted in vain to secure the surrender of Manila to himself was
not cooperation. That he refrained from attacking the Americans and
occasionally permitted them to be furnished supplies, for which they
paid, was not cooperation. The fact that for a time their plans and his
plans were parallel does not mean cooperation. Aguinaldo was forced by
the exigencies of the situation, by the necessity of strengthening his
hold upon the people, by the necessities of his operations against the
Spaniards, to make Spaniards and natives alike believe that all that he
did was with the aid of the Americans by whom he would be supported in
all his acts. He needed their support, and if he could not obtain that
he needed the appearance of their support for the attainment of his
ends; and this he was forced to purchase by compliance, or apparent
compliance, with their demands. But his compliance with them, as all
American officers serving there well knew, was never willing, was never
complete, and was never given except under pressure. It is true that
writers upon the subject, speaking with the confidence which is born of
insufficient and incomplete information, assure their readers that any
government but that of the United States, any colonial administrators
but Americans, would have been able to obtain the hearty cooperation of
Aguinaldo and his followers by judicious concessions to them at this
time. The only concession which would have obtained that hearty
cooperation would have been the recognition of the independence of the
Philippines under a United States protectorate, of Aguinaldo clothed
with the plenitude of the powers of the Katip&uacute;nan as dictator,
and a promise to promptly withdraw from the islands. This promise the
Government of the United States could not make. Until the ratification
of a treaty of peace with Spain the insurgents of the Philippine
Islands were rebellious subjects of Spain, and with them, except as
fighting men, no relations could be had.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;No report of operations or returns of strength were rendered
by Aguinaldo at this or any other time to any American commander, and
no American commander ever rendered such returns to him. At the time of
General Merritt&rsquo;s arrival, and until Manila was occupied by the
Americans, the insurgents and United States troops were united solely
by the fact that they had Manila as a common objective. Conditions were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>such that the Americans, in order to obtain its
surrender, had to avoid doing anything which might cause the insurgents
to attack them and perhaps make terms with Spain; while Aguinaldo and
his followers, in order to accomplish the surrender of Manila to
themselves, had to maintain such relations with the Americans as would
induce the Spaniards to believe that their fleet was at his
disposal,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4111src" href="#xd26e4111" name=
"xd26e4111src">111</a> and also such apparent harmony and cooperation
with them in the execution of their plans that the recalcitrant among
the Filipinos would be forced to believe that the Americans would in
all ways use their forces to support Aguinaldo in the attainment of his
desires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Merritt saw this and the necessity for immediately
taking such steps as would lead to his occupation of Manila. With the
arrival of the third expedition he was able to pass through the
insurgent lines between Camp Dewey and Manila, for he had sufficient
force to accept no refusal from Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his report he said that the insurgents had obtained
positions of investment opposite the Spanish lines along their full
extent, and that on the bay front their lines ran within 800 yards of
San Antonio Abad. The approaches to the beach and village of Pasay were
in their possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;This anomalous state of affairs, namely, having
a line of quasi-hostile native troops between our forces and the
Spanish position, was, of course, very objectionable, but it was
difficult to deal with owing to the peculiar conditions of our
relations with the insurgents&#8202;&hellip;. As General Aguinaldo did
not visit me on my arrival nor offer his services as a subordinate
military leader, and as my instructions from the President fully
contemplated the occupation of the islands by the American land forces,
and stated that &ldquo;the powers of the military occupant are absolute
and supreme and immediately operate upon the political condition of the
inhabitants,&rdquo; I did not consider it wise to hold any direct
communication with the insurgent leader until I should be in possession
of the city of Manila, especially as I would not until then be in a
position to issue a proclamation and enforce my authority in the event
that his pretensions should clash with my designs. For these reasons
the preparations for the attack on the city were pressed and the
military operations conducted without reference to the situation of the
insurgent forces. The wisdom of this course was subsequently fully
established by the fact that when the troops at my command carried the
Spanish entrenchments, extending from the sea to the Pasay road on the
extreme Spanish right, we were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>under no obligation, by
prearranged plans of the mutual attack, to turn to the right and clear
the front still held by the insurgents, but were able to move forward
at once and occupy the city and the
suburbs.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4125src" href=
"#xd26e4125" name="xd26e4125src">112</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that the Insurgents and the Americans ever had in common was an
enemy. They each fought that enemy in their own way. There was no
co&ouml;peration. On the part of the Insurgents there was treachery. I
will submit further evidence of this fact. <span class=

well in not having any controversy with the Americans. After having

&ldquo;You should not forget what I have stated at the beginning of
this letter; because I am of the opinion that those questions should be
well considered by all of you. If our people desire independence under
the American protectorate, it is necessary that our representatives to
the United States be given instructions as to the conditions which we
should grant to the United States. The peace negotiations are in full
blast, and it is probable that we will be rather late in sending our
representatives. Therefore, if you agree to independence under a
protectorate, you should recommend it at once. I leave it, however, to
your care, as you are better qualified than myself concerning the
conditions of our country.&rdquo;&mdash;P.I.R., 471.4.&nbsp;<a class=

&ldquo;My Dear Friend: &hellip; The last telegrams from Europe which
Felipe will send you by this mail are alarming for our future. The
preliminaries of peace are announced. The demand of America is,
annexation of Porto Rico and the Ladrone Islands, independence of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73n" href="#pb73n" name=
"pb73n">73</a>]</span>Cuba under an American protectorate and an
American coaling station in the Philippines. That is, they will again
deliver us into the hands of Spain. On the other hand, all the powers
will unite to prevent the annexation of the Philippines, according to
the telegrams of Regidor; the American cabinet hesitates about
including us in the negotiations for peace from fear of a conflict with
us and the Filipinos in Europe advise us to send a message to America
giving our unconditional adhesion. If events will be what these
telegrams indicate, we have a dark and bloody future before us. To be
again in the hands of Spain will mean a long and bloody war, and it is
doubtful whether the end will be favourable to us. The treaty of peace
sanctioned by the other powers will assure the dominion of Spain. Spain
free from Cuba and her other colonies will employ all her energy to
crush us and will send here the 150,000 men she has in Cuba. I do not
think that the Filipinos will again submit to their tyrants and there
will be a long and bloody war. And on account of the treaty the other
powers will aid Spain to completely dominate us and place all possible
obstacles in our way to prevent shipment of arms and all kinds of
revolutionary labours. In view of all this and bearing in mind the
present urgency of the matter, it is necessary for that government to
establish and publish its policy. We believe that the best for us and
the only feasible one, if we want to establish negotiations with
America, is independence under an American
protectorate.&rdquo;&mdash;P.I.R., 453.3.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

within and without the city of Manila and in the neighboring provinces
not under the control of the Spanish Government, are evading the orders
issued by these Headquarters, and in view of the large number of those
who are storing and monopolizing food and other most necessary
articles, under the pretence of desiring to sell them to the Americans,
but whose real intention is to ship them secretly to Manila where they
receive higher <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85n" href="#pb85n" name=

the injury they are doing the cause of our independence, I have seen
fit to decree the following: &hellip;&rdquo; P.I.R., 45.5 and
125.3.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Relative to this matter, Taylor
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The defection of Buencamino and Pilar
had opened the road to Aguinaldo, but at first the blockade was not
effective. There were too many natives there with friends and relations
in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s camp to make him desire to subject the city to the
hardships of an effective siege. And, furthermore, he did not have the
force, nor did his men have the necessary discipline, to prevent the
ingress of supplies. It was not until the first part of July that the
price of provisions increased. It was at no time found necessary by the
authorities to take over all the stores of provisions in the city.
Indeed, there seems to have been a fairly steady traffic in supplies
between Manila and the country to the north. It was a traffic in which
it has been charged that certain Spanish officers of rank made large
sums. Aguinaldo permitted it, and on July 26, 1898, signed an order
directing that food should be sent into Manila from the north to
prevent starvation in the city, and ordered the heads of the towns in
the vicinity not to interfere with this traffic (P.I.R., 1087&ndash;4).
The entrance of food supplies was confined to the northern line, for
then it would not be known to the Americans who, after July 30,
occupied the entrenchments in front of San Antonio Abad. It was not
expedient for them to see too much of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
methods.&rdquo;&mdash;Taylor, 14 AJ.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It will be remembered that the minutes of the session
of the Hong Kong junta at which Aguinaldo reported the result of his
negotiations with Pratt and received his instructions relative to the
trip to Manila, recorded the fact that there would be no better
occasion for the expeditionary forces &ldquo;to arm themselves at the
expense of the Americans,&rdquo; and that provided with arms the
Filipino people would be able to oppose themselves to the United States
and combat their demands if they attempted to colonize the
country.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4141src" href="#xd26e4141" name=
"xd26e4141src">1</a></p>
<p>The possible, if not the probable, desirability of attacking the
United States troops was, it is evident, clearly foreseen from the
beginning. Active preparations for doing this now soon began.</p>
<p>Although Insurgent officers in full uniform freely visited Manila at
all times, Aguinaldo wrote on October 1 to his commander in Laguna
Province that he must not permit Americans there without passes. He was
to get rid of them civilly, but he was to keep them out and inform all
authorities there of his instructions.</p>
<p>On August 24 an American soldier was killed and others were wounded
in Cavite by Insurgent troops who fired from behind. An Insurgent
officer in Cavite at the time reported on his record of services that
he&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;took part in the movement against the Americans
on the afternoon of the 24th of August, under the orders of the
commander of the troops and the adjutant of the post.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>This shows that the movement was ordered, but the Insurgents
promptly realized that it was ill advised.</p>
<p>On August 28 General Llanera was reported to be preparing for
operations against the Americans. He was ordered to suspend his
preparations. The same day General P. Mercado Rizal, commanding in
Laguna Province, wrote Mabini asking whether they were to consider the
Americans as their allies or their enemies. He wanted to know whether
the war was to stop or continue becoming more furious. This not because
he desired to ask questions about the secrets of the government, but
because he wished to prepare the minds of the people for the future.
Mabini&rsquo;s answer has not been found.</p>

</div>
<p>We have already noted that on August 8 Fernando Acevedo wrote
General P&iacute;o del Pilar recommending that he attack and annihilate
the American troops; that on August 10 Pilar wrote Aguinaldo suggesting
that the Americans be attacked, and that on August 17 Aguinaldo
stated&rdquo; &ldquo;The conflict is coming sooner or
later.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4171src" href="#xd26e4171"
name="xd26e4171src">2</a></p>
<p>At this time Sandico entered the service of the Americans as an
interpreter and acted as a spy, endeavouring to keep his people fully
informed relative to the plans and acts of his employers. Incidentally
he endeavoured to convince the latter that the barbarities really
committed by Insurgent officers and troops in Manila were perpetrated
by enemies of the Insurgent cause who wished to discredit it.</p>
<p>In a letter dated September 21, 1898, Apacible says that the
conflict will come sooner or later and asks Aguinaldo if it would not
be better for them to provoke it before the Americans concentrate their
troops.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4179src" href="#xd26e4179" name=
"xd26e4179src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>On September 10 General Garcia reported to Aguinaldo that on the
previous night the Americans had attempted to push back his line at San
Lazaro, and that morning had concentrated and penetrated the Insurgent
territory, making a reconnaissance through the fields about Sampaloc.
Aguinaldo put an endorsement on this communication saying that he had
long since ordered that the Insurgent line should not be passed. He
instructed Garcia to throw troops in front of the Americans at
Sampaloc, and order them to leave, and to warn the bolo men. Obviously,
little more was needed to provoke an Insurgent attack.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4187src" href="#xd26e4187" name=
"xd26e4187src">4</a></p>
<p>An unsigned draft of an order in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s handwriting dated
Malolos, September 13 (?), 1898,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4192src"
href="#xd26e4192" name="xd26e4192src">5</a> shows how tense was the
situation while the question of withdrawal of the Insurgent forces from
the city of Manila was under consideration. It contains instructions
for General P&iacute;o del Pilar, General P. Garcia and General Noriel
or Colonel Cailles. Their purpose is hardly open to doubt.</p>
<p>General P&iacute;o del Pilar was directed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;To have a detachment posted in the interval
from the branch of the river of Paco in a northerly direction to the
bridge and so on up to the Pasig river in the direction of Pandacan,
the river serving as a line until the suburb of Panque is reached which
will be under our jurisdiction. Proceed to execute <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>this
order on its receipt, posting detachments where they are necessary and
trenches will be made without loss of time working day and night. Do
not rest for by doing so we may lose the opportunity; beg of the troops
to assist in the formation of intrenchments. Matters have a bad aspect,
we especially expect something Wednesday and Thursday, the 15th and
16th of this month. The danger is imminent on the mentioned days, also
in the time that follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep strict vigilance at all hours. In case you receive
orders to leave that place, do not do so on any account without my
orders, happen what may&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concentrate all your forces in Santa Ana before the day
arrives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warn your soldiers against firing at random as the Spaniards
did, if possible have them calculate the number of their antagonists
and how much ammunition there is in comparison with the number of the
attacking force, in fact, there are occasions when each shot fired
kills as many as four men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will see to the execution of these instructions
and that you will maintain the honour of the Philippines by your
courage and in no way permit your rights to be trampled
underfoot.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4210src" href="#xd26e4210"
name="xd26e4210src">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Garcia was instructed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On Wednesday, the 14th of this month, you will
post detachments in the points indicated by lines on the enclosed plan.
On receipt of this and as soon as you learn its contents, proceed
secretly to determine the most suitable places to post detachments and
immediately post our troops and have intrenchments made employing day
and night in this work. Beg this of our soldiers.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4218src" href="#xd26e4218" name=
"xd26e4218src">7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The instructions to Noriel or Cailles read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning of
Wednesday, the 14th, withdraw your command from the town of Malate as
indicated on the enclosed plan, from the bridge in Singalong and in a
straight line from there to the branch of the river in Paco will be the
line of our jurisdiction even though we may not be of one mind in the
matter. On receipt of this proceed to determine the most suitable
places to post our troops even if they are not supplied with batteries;
on posting the detachments give instructions to have intrenchments made
immediately without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>resting, especially on the days of the 15th
and 16th. Since affairs have a serious aspect, do not lose vigilance
and be on the alert at all times&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concentrate all the forces and have a call to arms in Cavite
so that all the troops may be in Pasay on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case the Americans attempt to order you out do not leave
your posts, happen what may, but exercise prudence and be prepared
leaving them to give the provocation. Answer them that you have no
instructions given you with regard to what they ask.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4233src" href="#xd26e4233" name=
"xd26e4233src">8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the maintenance of peace at this time hung by a very
slender thread. On September 14 the governor of Cavite telegraphed
Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. I desire to know from you the
result of the ultimatum. Advise me if we must prepare our troops for
action to-morrow. I await a reply.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4241src" href="#xd26e4241" name="xd26e4241src">9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But war was not to begin at this time. On September 23 Bray wrote to
Aguinaldo advising him to maintain a defensive attitude until the
result of the negotiations at Paris should become known, giving way to
the Americans and not showing his teeth. He could take the offensive
later if advisable and should have little difficulty in settling
accounts with the American soldiers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4248src" href="#xd26e4248" name="xd26e4248src">10</a></p>
<p>Bray suggested the possibility of an alliance between the American
and the Spanish soldiers if a conflict should arise before the
departure of the latter.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4253src" href=
"#xd26e4253" name="xd26e4253src">11</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile preparations for the attack progressed. During September,
Sandico wrote Aguinaldo suggesting the urgent necessity of reorganizing
the &ldquo;masons&rdquo; and the Katip&uacute;nan,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4259src" href="#xd26e4259" name="xd26e4259src">12</a> and that
all be furnished with knives, to be kept hidden so that they might be
&ldquo;ready for any event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of efforts to keep the Insurgent soldiers in hand, feeling
among them ran high, and they wanted to fight.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4264src" href="#xd26e4264" name="xd26e4264src">13</a> On November
30, 1898, General Mascardo telegraphed from San Fernando to Aguinaldo
asking if he might begin firing in order to prevent the American troops
from disembarking, and Aguinaldo promptly answered in the
affirmative.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4267src" href="#xd26e4267"
name="xd26e4267src">14</a></p>
<p>On December 5 Malvar telegraphed from Lipa that according to a
despatch from Batangas, American divers were working unceasingly and
that a subordinate had ordered that they be fired on if they attempted
to land. Aguinaldo replied that he did not mind their working at sea,
but that they must not be allowed to land under any
circumstances.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4278src" href="#xd26e4278"
name="xd26e4278src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>On December 6 Sandico telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The difficulty of last night at the San Juan
picket with the American troops has been adjusted without prejudice.
Our preparations ought to continue. Awaiting orders.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4292src" href="#xd26e4292" name=
"xd26e4292src">16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>San Juan was where the firing commenced on February 4, 1899.</p>
<p>On December 9 Cailles wired Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Report to you that there are 3000 Americans in
front of our position at Singalong. I do not know what they wish; if
they enter Pineda I open fire.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4302src" href="#xd26e4302" name="xd26e4302src">17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this time the Insurgents had made up their minds that the
Americans, who had been bearing their insults in silence, were cowards.
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s indorsement on this telegram reads:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Answered: Nevertheless the 3000 American
soldiers are few against my Colonel and his 300 soldiers, and I believe
you have more than that number. E. A., Dec. 12, 1898.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4312src" href="#xd26e4312" name=
"xd26e4312src">18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relative to the insults which were at this time showered upon
Americans, Taylor has made the following statement:<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4319src" href="#xd26e4319" name=
"xd26e4319src">19</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Fortune had been good to Aguinaldo and his
associates in the eight months during which the United States had
prevented Spain from relieving her beleaguered garrisons in the
Philippines, and she might still be kind. The men about Aguinaldo who
had risen farthest and fastest could not endure the thought of having
to accept subordinate positions in a government not directed by
themselves. The halberdiers at the door of the palace of the president
saluted them as the halberdiers at the doorway of his lordship the
governor-general in Manila had struck the marble steps with their
halberds at the coming of the Spanish generals. They swaggered down the
streets of Malolos, clashing their swords behind them, and they knew
that if they won, the Philippines would be divided into fiefs which
they, as dukes and marquises, would hold in feudal tenure from a Malay
potentate. They were confident. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>held Luz&oacute;n.
They held the people. They had no intention of returning to office
stools or to the life of outlaws and hunted men. The United States
force in Manila was small and America was far. It was true that they
might have to fight for the prize which they had seized, but the
military leaders about Aguinaldo were confident of winning in case they
fought. They believed the Americans were afraid of them and would be
easily beaten. American soldiers had been seized and had been insulted
by the followers of Aguinaldo and no resort had been made to force. The
Americans had been ordered to avoid bringing on an engagement and had
obeyed. It is also probable that many of the insults to which they had
been subjected were not appreciated by them. A tall soldier from
western America paid no attention to the insults hurled at him in a
language which he did not understand. And yet the small excited
Filipinos might retire feeling that the American had tamely submitted
to insult worse than a blow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the middle of December, Aguinaldo had placed in position in the
vicinity of Manila all of the field guns in his possession.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10. It provided for the
termination of Spanish sovereignty in the Philippines. This was what
the Insurgents had been waiting for, and thereafter things moved
rapidly. It is obvious that an attack was definitely planned for at
this time, for on December 21, Commandant F. E. Rey telegraphed
Aguinaldo that the second chief of the second zone of Manila had
directed him to assist by entering that city as soon as they opened
fire against the American troops.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4332src"
href="#xd26e4332" name="xd26e4332src">20</a></p>
<p>On the following day Cailles reported that he had occupied
blockhouse No. 12, which was within the American lines, and added the
following significant statement:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The order of yesterday was, on hearing the
first shots from Santa Ana, for my whole force to hurl themselves on
the American line of trenches, and to follow the living to Manila. The
dead can lie with the dead. Yesterday we were content waiting for the
arming of the San Quintin.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4341src"
href="#xd26e4341" name="xd26e4341src">21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>San Quintin&rsquo;s Day was the anniversary of the Sicilian vespers,
the massacre of the French in Sicily in 1268. Obviously the Insurgents
were planning something similar for Manila.</p>
<p>For some reason the attack was not made as planned, but there was no
intention of abandoning it. Within fifteen days of January 1 some
40,000 Filipinos left Manila. Why? On January 7, Aguinaldo wrote to
Se&ntilde;or Benito Legarda at Manila, saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I beg you to leave Manila with your family and
come here to Malolos, but not because I wish to frighten you&mdash;I
merely wish to warn you for your satisfaction, although it is not yet
the day or the week.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4351src" href=
"#xd26e4351" name="xd26e4351src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many details of the plan of attack have come into our possession.
Doctor Manuel Xeres Burgos wrote Aguinaldo during January relative to a
plan for an uprising of the prisoners in Bilibid Prison, saying that it
should by all means come &ldquo;before the movement is begun anywhere
else,&rdquo; and calling attention to the necessity of stationing men
to prevent the American soldiers near by in the Zorilla theatre from
coming to the rescue. On the back of this letter there is a sketch plan
showing where bolo men were to be stationed, ready to attack these
soldiers.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4357src" href="#xd26e4357" name=

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=

<p>In his message to Congress dated January 1, 1899, Aguinaldo
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I consider arguments unnecessary in support of
the proposed amendments, every one knows that our newborn Republic now
has to fight for its existence against giants in ambition and in
power.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4373src" href="#xd26e4373"
name="xd26e4373src">24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An unsigned letter addressed to Apacible on January 4, 1899,
contains the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It appears that conflict with the Americans is
imminent and inevitable. Several of their vessels with thousands of
soldiers commanded by General Miller were sent to Iloilo on December
20th last to take that port together with the whole of Visayas and
Mindanao.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4381src" href="#xd26e4381"
name="xd26e4381src">25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 4 the following significant telegram was sent
out:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Circular Telegram from the Secretary of the
Interior to Provincial Presidents, wherever there may be Telegraphic
Service, to be communicated to the Local Chiefs of each Town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Malolos</span>, January 4, 1899, 9.35
A.M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Provincial President of the Province of
Pangasin&aacute;n:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasten the preparation of all the towns in order to oppose
the American invasion. See that all the inhabitants prepare their bolos
and daggers; also that in each street and barrio national militia is
organized, each six of whom should be commanded by a corporal, each
thirteen by a sergeant, each twenty-six by a second lieutenant, each
fifty-two by a first lieutenant, and each one hundred and four by a
captain, directing that the soldiers of the national militia elect
their own officers, informing all that upon our attitude depends our
salvation.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lingayen</span>, January 4, 1899.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a note thereon which reads:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Communicate this to all of the local chiefs,
and to the commanding general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Signed by initials which are illegible, but evidently those of the
Provincial President.)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4412src" href=

</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>On January 5, 1899, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation which contains
the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The said generals accepted my concessions in
favor of peace and friendship as indications of weakness. Thus it is,
that with rising ambition, they ordered forces to Iloilo on December
26, with the purpose of acquiring for themselves the title of
conquerors of that portion of the Philippine Islands occupied by my
govermnent.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;My government cannot remain indifferent in view of such a
violent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by a
nation which has arrogated to itself the title, &lsquo;champion of
oppressed nations.&rsquo; Thus it is that my government is ready to
open hostilities if the American troops attempt to take forcible
possession of the Visayan Islands. I announce these rights before the
world, in order that the conscience of mankind may pronounce its
infallible verdict as to who are the true oppressors of nations and the
tormentors of human kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon their heads be all the blood which may be
shed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4429src" href="#xd26e4429"
name="xd26e4429src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three days later this proclamation, which was rather dangerously
like a declaration of war, was reissued with a significant change in
the last one of the passages quoted, the words &ldquo;attempt to take
forcible possession of any part of the territory submitted to its
jurisdiction&rdquo; being substituted for the words &ldquo;attempt to
take forcible possession of the Visayan Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On January 8, 1899, at 9.40 P.M., Sandico telegraphed Aguinaldo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;In
consequence of the orders of General Rios to his officers, as soon as
the Filipino attack begins the Americans should be driven into the
Intramuros district and the Walled city should be set on
fire.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4442src" href="#xd26e4442"
name="xd26e4442src">28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preparations for the attack, which was to begin inside the city of
Manila, were now rapidly pushed to conclusion. I quote Taylor&rsquo;s
excellent summary of them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;After Aguinaldo&rsquo;s proclamation of January
5 the number of organizations charged with an attack within the city
increased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>rapidly and it is possible that those which had
been formed during Spanish rule had never been disbanded.
Sandico&rsquo;s clubs for athletic exercises and mutual improvement
formed a nucleus for these bodies and the directing boards of the
popular committees took up the work of recruiting, while some of the
members became officers of the militia or sandatahan. On January 6 the
commander of militia in Trozo, Manila, reported that 1130 soldiers had
been enrolled by the popular committee. On January 7 Bonifacio
Ar&eacute;valo forwarded to the head of the central committee a list of
the officers of the battalion which had just been organized in Sampaloc
for the defence of their liberties. Apparently about the same time J.
Limjap submitted to Sandico a project for arming the prisoners in
Bilibid Prison with the arms of the American soldiers quartered in the
Zorrilla Theatre across the street. He said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Jacinto Limjap having been proclaimed commander
of the volunteers of the penitentiary, I ask you to authorize the
creation of a disciplinary battalion and the provisional appointments
of officers for 600 sandatahan, or militia, ready to provide themselves
by force with the American rifles in the Zorrilla Theatre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He followed by a statement of the officers desired. It was
not difficult for him to obtain volunteers there to rob, to burn, to
rape and to murder. These were the crimes for which they were serving
sentences. The political prisoners had been
released&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On January 18 Sandico approved of the officers for the first
battalion organized by the committees of Sampaloc; on January 27 he
approved those of the second battalion. By January 22 two battalions
had been organized in Quiapo. At least one regiment of eight companies
was raised in Binondo, for on January 23 its commander forwarded a roll
of the officers to Aguinaldo for his approval&#8202;&hellip;. On
January 25 T. Sandico, at Malolos, submitted for approval the names of
a number of officers of the territorial militia in the city of Manila.
On January 30, 1899, a roll of four companies just organized in Malate
was forwarded approved by T. Sandico, and on the same day the committee
of Trozo, Manila, applied to T. Sandico for permission to recruit a
body for the defence of the country. The regiment of &lsquo;Armas
Blancas&rsquo; had already been raised in Tondo and Binondo. It was in
existence there in December, 1898, and may have been originally
organized to act against Spain. On February 2 all officers of the
territorial militia in Manila reported <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>at Caloocan, in
accordance with orders of Sandico, for the purpose of receiving their
commissions and taking the oath to the flag. A man who took part in
this ceremony wrote that a multitude of men were present in uniform,
and that the oath was administered by Gen. Pantale&oacute;n
Garc&iacute;a. There is no reason for believing that this is a complete
statement of sandatahan organized in Manila by the end of January, and
yet this statement gives a force of at least 6330 men. General Otis
said that this force had been reported to him as being 10,000 men. It
is probably true that only a small number of them had rifles; but armed
with long knives and daggers they could have inflicted much damage in a
sudden night attack in the narrow and badly lighted streets of Manila.
On January 9, 1899, Aguinaldo wrote his instructions for the sandatahan
of Manila. Members of this body were to enter the houses of the
American officers on the pretext of bringing them presents. Once in
they were to kill. The sentinels at the gates of the barracks were to
be approached by men dressed as women and killed. The gates of the
barracks held and as many officers as possible treacherously murdered,
the sandatahan were to rise throughout the city, and by attacking in
the rear the United States troops on the outer line were to aid in
opening a way for Aguinaldo&rsquo;s force. To further increase the
confusion and perhaps to punish the natives who had not joined them,
the sandatahan were to fire the city.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;It is a fair deduction from Luna&rsquo;s orders for an
uprising in Manila, from Aguinaldo&rsquo;s instructions for the
sandatahan, from other documents among the papers of the insurgents and
from what was done in Manila on February 22 that Aguinaldo and his
advisers about the middle of January, 1899, drew up a plan of attack
upon Manila which would, if carried out, have inflicted a severe blow
upon the Americans. It was not carried out, but that was not the fault
of Aguinaldo or of Luna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that the instructions were general; but that
particular instructions were given by Aguinaldo himself for the murder
of General Otis is shown by his note on the back of a document
presented to him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4468src" href="#xd26e4468"
name="xd26e4468src">29</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; And then there was nothing abhorrent to Aguinaldo
and the men about him in beginning a war by the murder of the
commanding general on the other side.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Aguinaldo and all his followers have declared that
on February 4 the Americans attacked the unsuspecting Filipinos who
were using their utmost efforts to avoid a war. And yet here in
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s own handwriting is the record of the fact that on
January 10, 1899, he ordered the murder of the American commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The attack which Aguinaldo was preparing to deliver upon and
in Manila was not to be a mere raid such as the bandits of Cavite were
in the habit of making upon the defenceless towns. The plan was a piece
of calculated savagery in which murder and outrage were considered
means to accomplish a purpose. The servants were to kill their
employers; organized bands, dressed in the dress of civilians, living
in the city of Manila under the government of the Americans, in many
cases employed by the Americans, were to suddenly fall upon the
barracks of the American soldiers and massacre the inmates; all
Americans in the streets were to be killed, the city was to be fired
and its loot was to be the reward of loyalty to Aguinaldo. If this plan
had been carried out no white man and no white woman would have
escaped. The reinforcements from the United States would have arrived
to find only the smoking ruins of Manila. Buencamino had warned General
August&iacute;n what the fate of Manila would be if taken by a horde of
Indians drunk with victory. That fate was now deliberately planned for
the city. Aguinaldo planned to occupy the capital not as it had been
occupied by the Americans. He planned to take it as Count Tilly took
Magdeburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The authors of this plan were not savages. Mabini, Sandico,
and Luna, Asiatics educated in European schools, were men of trained
and subtle minds. With them cruelty and assassination was not a matter
of savage impulse but of deliberate calculation; with them
assassination was employed as an effective addition to political
propaganda, and murder as an ultimate resource in political
manoeuvres.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4485src" href=
"#xd26e4485" name="xd26e4485src">30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some portions of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s instructions to the
<i>sandatahan</i> are particularly worthy of perpetuation, as they
illustrate his ideas as to the conduct which should be observed by
cultured, patriotic, honourable and very humane men, who were not
cruel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 3. The chief of
those who go to attack the barracks should send in first four men with
a good present for the American <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>commander. Immediately after
will follow four others who will make a pretence of looking for the
same officer for some reason and a larger group shall be concealed in
the corners or houses in order to aid the other groups at the first
signal. This wherever it is possible at the moment of attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 4. They should not, prior to the
attack, look at the Americans in a threatening manner. To the contrary,
the attack on the barracks by the sandatahan should be a complete
surprise and with decision and courage. One should go alone in advance
in order to kill the sentinel. In order to deceive the sentinel one of
them should dress as a woman and must take great care that the sentinel
is not able to discharge his piece, thus calling the attention of those
in the barracks. This will enable his companions who are approaching to
assist in the general attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 5. At the moment of the attack
the sandatahan should not attempt to secure rifles from their dead
enemies, but shall pursue, slashing right and left with bolos until the
Americans surrender, and after there remains no enemy who can injure
them, they may take the rifles in one hand and the ammunition in the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 6. The officers shall take care
that on the tops of the houses along the streets where the American
forces shall pass there will be placed four to six men, who shall be
prepared with stones, timbers, red-hot iron, heavy furniture, as well
as boiling water, oil and molasses, rags soaked in coal oil ready to be
lighted and thrown down, and any other hard and heavy objects that they
can throw on the passing American troops. At the same time in the lower
parts of the houses will be concealed the sandatahan, who will attack
immediately. Great care should be taken not to throw glass in the
streets, as the greater part of our soldiers go barefooted. On these
houses there will, if possible, be arranged, in addition to the objects
to be thrown down, a number of the sandatahan, in order to cover a
retreat or to follow up a rout of the enemy&rsquo;s column, so that we
may be sure of the destruction of all the opposing forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 7. All Filipinos, real defenders
of their country, should live on the alert to assist simultaneously the
inside attack at the very moment that they note the first movement in
whatever barrio or suburb, having assurance that all the troops that
surround Manila will proceed without delay to force the enemy&rsquo;s
line and unite themselves with their brothers in the city. With such a
general movement, so firm and decided against the Americans, the combat
is sure to be a short one, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142"
href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>I charge and order that the
persons and goods of all foreigners shall be respected and that the
American prisoners shall be treated well.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 9. In addition to the
instructions given in paragraph 6, there shall be in the houses vessels
filled with boiling water, tallow, molasses and other liquids, which
shall be thrown as bombs on the Americans who pass in front of their
houses, or they can make use of syringes or tubes of bamboo. In these
houses shall be the sandatahan who shall hurl the liquids that shall be
passed to them by the women and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 10. In place of bolos or
daggers, if they do not possess the same, the sandatahan can provide
themselves with lances and arrows with long sharp heads, and these
should be shot with great force in order that they may penetrate well
into the bodies of the enemy, and these should be so made that in
withdrawal from the body the head will remain in the flesh.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Art</span>. 12&#8202;&hellip;. Neither will
you forget your sacred oath and immaculate banner; nor will you forget
the promises made by me to the civilized nations, whom I have assured
that we Filipinos are not savages, nor thieves, nor assassins, nor are
we cruel, but on the contrary, that we are men of culture and
patriotism, honourable and very humane.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4542src" href="#xd26e4542" name="xd26e4542src">31</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo enjoined order on his subordinates.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4548src" href="#xd26e4548" name="xd26e4548src">32</a></p>
<p>The Filipinos were now ready to assume the offensive, but desired,
if possible, to provoke the Americans into firing the first shot. They
made no secret of their desire for conflict, but increased their
hostile demonstrations and pushed their lines forward into forbidden
territory. Their attitude is well illustrated by the following extract
from a telegram sent by Colonel Cailles to Aguinaldo on January 10,
1899:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. An American interpreter has come
to tell me to withdraw our forces in Maytubig fifty paces. I shall
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>not draw back a step, and in place of
withdrawing, I shall advance a little farther. He brings a letter from
his general, in which he speaks to me as a friend. I said that from the
day I knew that Maquinley (McKinley) opposed our independence I did not
want any dealings with any American. War, war, is what we want. The
Americans after this speech went off pale.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4558src" href="#xd26e4558" name="xd26e4558src">33</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo approved the hostile attitude of Cailles, for there is a
reply in his handwriting which reads:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I approve and applaud what you have done with
the Americans, and zeal and valour always, also my beloved officers and
soldiers there. I believe that they are playing us until the arrival of
their reinforcements, but I shall send an ultimatum and remain always
on the alert.&mdash;E. A. Jan. 10, 1899.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4566src" href="#xd26e4566" name="xd26e4566src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this same day Aguinaldo commissioned Feliciano Cruz and Severino
Quitiongco to assassinate General Otis.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4574src" href="#xd26e4574" name="xd26e4574src">35</a></p>
<p>On January 13 Noriel and Cailles telegraphed Aguinaldo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We desire to know results of ultimatum which
you mention in your telegram, and we also wish to know what reward our
Government is arranging for the forces that will be able first to enter
Manila.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This telegram is endorsed in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s handwriting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;As to the contents of your telegram, those who
will be the heroes will have as their rewards a large quantity of
money, extraordinary rewards, promotions, crosses of
Biak-na-bat&oacute;, Marquis of Malate, Ermita, Count of Manila, etc.,
besides the congratulations of our idolizing country on account of
their being patriotic, and more, if they capture the regiments with
their generals, and, if possible, the chief of them all who represents
our future enemies in Manila, which (lot?) falls to you, or, better
said, to General Noriel and Colonel Cailles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ultimatum has not been sent, but it will be within a few
days.</p>

<p>On January 14, 1899, the people at Aparri shouted: &ldquo;Death to
the Americans,&rdquo; and held a review to celebrate the rupture of
friendly relations with the United States.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4613src" href="#xd26e4613" name="xd26e4613src">37</a></p>
<p>At this time Aguinaldo had a dream about a victorious attack upon
Manila and telegraphed it to some of his officers. General
Garc&iacute;a replied from Caloocan on January 17 that the dream would
come true as soon as the conflict with the Americans began.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4618src" href="#xd26e4618" name=
"xd26e4618src">38</a></p>
<p>In January 21, 1899, Aguinaldo was still not quite ready, and
ordered that the Filipino soldiers in the walled city keep on good
terms with the Americans, in order to deceive them, &ldquo;since the
hoped-for moment has not yet arrived.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4623src" href="#xd26e4623" name="xd26e4623src">39</a></p>
<p>The Insurgents grew surer and surer that the Americans were
cowards,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4633src" href="#xd26e4633" name=
"xd26e4633src">40</a> and openly boasted that when the attack began
they would drive them into the sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>On January 21 General Otis wrote to Admiral Dewey that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The insurgents will not now permit us to cross
their lines and have been very insulting to our officers, calling to
them that very shortly they will give us battle. My best information is
that they have fully determined to attack both outside and within the
city before our additional troops arrive, and the least spark may start
a conflagration.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4646src" href=
"#xd26e4646" name="xd26e4646src">41</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the date of the proposed attack drew near, the work of
strengthening the Insurgent positions around Manila was pushed with all
possible speed.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4651src" href="#xd26e4651"
name="xd26e4651src">42</a></p>
<p>About the middle of January General Otis stationed the First
Nebraska Regiment upon the high ground at Santa Mesa for sanitary
reasons. Of conditions at this time, and of the circumstances leading
to the actual outbreak of hostilities Taylor says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;During the latter part of January General Otis
was informed on good insurgent authority that the insurgents meditated
an attack upon those troops, and he was advised to remove them, as in
their exposed position they would kill them all. General MacArthur,
under whose command the regiment was, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>placed two guns in
position there, as it was fully expected that the insurgents would
direct their attack upon that point, as in fact they did. On February
4, 1899, the tents of the regiment covered the ridge, and its outposts
extended along the San Juan River, a small stream which formed part of
the line of delimitation between the Americans and the insurgents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some days before the outbreak of hostilities the pressure
of the insurgents was constant along this position, so constant indeed
that in the light of subsequent events it indicated a premeditated
purpose on the part of some one in the insurgent army to force a
collision at that point. On February 2 General MacArthur, commanding
the Second Division of the Eighth Army Corps, wrote to the commanding
general of the Filipino troops in the third zone in front of him
that&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;An armed party from your command now occupies
the village in front of blockhouse No. 7, at a point considerably more
than a hundred yards on my side of the line, and is very active in
exhibiting hostile intentions. This party must be withdrawn to your
side of the line at once. From this date if the line is crossed by your
men with arms in their hands they must be regarded as subject to such
action as I may deem necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel San Miguel, who commanded at San Juan del Monte,
replied upon the receipt of this communication that the action of his
troops was foreign to his wishes and that he would give immediate
orders for them to retire. At about half past 8 on the night of
February 4 a small insurgent patrol entered the territory within the
American lines at blockhouse No. 7 and advanced to the little village
of Santol in front of an outpost of the Nebraska regiment. This was the
same point from which the insurgents had been compelled to retire on
February 2. An American outpost challenged, and then as the insurgent
patrol continued to advance the sentinel fired, whereupon the insurgent
patrol retired to blockhouse No. 7, from which fire was immediately
opened upon the Americans. This fire spread rapidly down the American
and insurgent lines and both forces at once sprang to
arms.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4676src" href="#xd26e4676"
name="xd26e4676src">43</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Otis&rsquo;s account of the opening of active hostilities
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On the night of February 2 they sent in a
strong detachment to draw the fire of our outposts, which took up a
position <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>immediately in front and within a few yards of
the same. The outpost was strengthened by a few of our men, who
silently bore their taunts and abuse the entire night. This was
reported to me by General MacArthur, whom I directed to communicate
with the officer in command of the insurgent troops concerned. His
prepared letter was shown me and approved, and the reply received was
all that could be desired. However, the agreement was ignored by the
insurgents and on the evening of February 4 another demonstration was
made on one of our small outposts, which occupied a retired position at
least 150 yards within the line which had been mutually agreed upon, an
insurgent approaching the picket and refusing to halt or answer when
challenged. The result was that our picket discharged his piece, when
the insurgent troops near Santa Mesa opened a spirited fire on our
troops there stationed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The insurgents had thus succeeded in drawing the fire of a
small outpost, which they had evidently labored with all their
ingenuity to accomplish, in order to justify in some way their
premeditated attack. It is not believed that the chief insurgent
leaders wished to open hostilities at this time, as they were not
completely prepared to assume the initiative. They desired two or three
days more to perfect their arrangements, but the zeal of their army
brought on the crisis which anticipated their premeditated action. They
could not have delayed long, however, for it was their object to force
an issue before American troops, then en route, could arrive in
Manila.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4688src" href="#xd26e4688"
name="xd26e4688src">44</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus began the Insurgent attack, so long and so carefully planned
for. We learn from the Insurgent records that the shot of the American
sentry missed its mark. There was no reason why it should have provoked
a hot return fire, but it did.</p>
<p>The result of the ensuing combat was not at all what the Insurgents
had anticipated. The Americans did not drive very well. It was but a
short time before they themselves were routed and driven from their
positions.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo of course promptly advanced the claim that his troops had
been wantonly attacked. The plain fact is that the Insurgent patrol in
question deliberately drew the fire of the American sentry, and this
was just as much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"
name="pb148">148</a>]</span>an act of war as was the firing of the
shot. Whether the patrol was acting under proper orders from higher
authority is not definitely known.</p>
<p>In this connection the following telegram sent by Captain Zialcita
from Santa Ana on February 4, 1899, at 9.55 P.M., to Major Gray, San
Juan del Monte, is highly interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I received the telegram forwarded from Malolos.
General Ricarte is not here. I believe (that if the) Americans open
fire we shall attack. Will ask instructions (of)
Malolos.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4704src" href="#xd26e4704"
name="xd26e4704src">45</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks as if Zialcita at least knew that something was to be
done to draw the American fire.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s first statement relative to the opening of
hostilities is embodied in a general order dated Malolos, February 4,
1899, and reads in part as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock P.M., this date, I received
from Caloocan station a message communicated to me that the American
forces, without prior notification or any just motive, attacked our
camp at San Juan del Monte and our forces garrisoning the blockhouses
around the outskirts of Manila, causing losses among our soldiers, who
in view of this unexpected aggression and of the decided attack of the
aggressors, were obliged to defend themselves until the firing became
general all along the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can deplore more than I this rupture of hostilities. I
have a clear conscience that I have endeavoured to avoid it at all
costs, using all my efforts to preserve friendship with the army of
occupation, even at the cost of not a few humiliations and many
sacrificed rights.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; I order and command:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. Peace and friendly relations between the Philippine forces
and the American forces of occupation are broken, and the latter will
be treated as enemies, with the limits prescribed by the laws of
war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. American soldiers who may be captured by the Philippine
forces will be treated as prisoners of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. This proclamation shall be communicated to the accredited
consuls of Manila, and to congress, in order that it may accord the
suspension of the constitutional guarantees and the resulting
declaration of war.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4726src" href=
"#xd26e4726" name="xd26e4726src">46</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s protestations relative to his efforts to avoid
hostilities are absurd, in view of his own instructions concerning the
attack to be made simultaneously within and without the city of
Manila.</p>
<p>There is other correspondence which throws light on the situation
which existed immediately prior to the outbreak of hostilities. On
January 25, 1899, Agoncillo cabled from Washington to Apacible in
Hongkong: &ldquo;Recommend you await beginning American aggression,
justifying our conduct nations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4737src" href="#xd26e4737" name="xd26e4737src">47</a></p>
<p>Apacible apparently did not take this view of the matter, for on
January 31 he wrote to Aguinaldo that the Senate in Washington would
take final vote upon the treaty of peace between the United States and
Spain on February 6, and said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is urgently necessary for America to answer
us immediately before the ratification of the treaty. A conflict after
the ratification of the treaty would be unfavorable to us in public
opinion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4745src" href="#xd26e4745"
name="xd26e4745src">48</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously this letter might be interpreted as a recommendation that
hostilities begin before February 6 if America did not answer
meanwhile. It was evidently well understood in Hongkong that
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s receipt of Apacible&rsquo;s letter might cause war to
begin, for on February 3, 1899, Bray, anticipating the outbreak of
hostilities of the following day, cabled Senator Hoar at Washington as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Receive caution news hostilities Manila
discredited here denied Filipino circles supposed political move
influence vote Senate to-day any ease insignificant skirmish due
intentional provocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Bray</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4758src" href="#xd26e4758" name="xd26e4758src">49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extracts from the Insurgent records above quoted leave no escape
from the conclusion that the outbreak of hostilities which occurred on
February 4, 1899, had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>carefully prepared for and was
deliberately precipitated by the Filipinos themselves.</p>
<p>Blount says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It would be simply wooden-headed to affirm that
they ever expected to succeed in a war with us.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4770src" href="#xd26e4770" name=
"xd26e4770src">50</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may have been wooden-headed for the Filipinos to expect this, but
expect it they certainly did. We have seen how they held their soldiers
in check until after Spain had been ousted from the Philippines by the
Treaty of Paris as they had originally planned to do. It now only
remained to carry out the balance of their original plan to get rid of
the Americans in one way or another.</p>
<p>General Otis states that &ldquo;when Aguinaldo had completed his
preparations for attack he prepared the outlines of his declaration of
war, the full text of which was published at Malolos on the evening,
and very shortly after, hostilities began. This declaration was
circulated in Manila on the morning of February 5.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4777src" href="#xd26e4777" name=
"xd26e4777src">51</a></p>
<p>The Insurgents brought down upon themselves the punishment which
they received on February 4 and 5.</p>
<p>Blount has stated<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4784src" href=
"#xd26e4784" name="xd26e4784src">52</a> that if the resolutions of
Senator Bacon introduced on January 11, 1899, had passed, we never
should have had any war with the Filipinos. The resolutions in question
concluded thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;That the United States hereby disclaim any
disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or
control over said islands except for the pacification thereof, and
assert their determination when an independent government shall have
been duly erected therein entitled to recognition as such, to transfer
to said government, upon terms which shall be reasonable and just, all
rights secured under the cession by Spain, and to thereupon leave the
government and control of the islands to their people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must take issue with Blount as to the effect which these
resolutions might have had if passed. The Insurgents <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>felt
themselves to be fully competent to bring about such pacification of
the islands as they deemed necessary. At the time the resolutions were
presented in the Senate their soldiers were straining at the leash,
ready to attack their American opponents upon the most slender excuse.
Aguinaldo himself could not have held them much longer, and it is not
impossible that they got away from him as it was. They would have
interpreted the passage of the Bacon resolutions as a further evidence
of weakness, and hastened their attack. As we have seen, &ldquo;war,
war, war&rdquo; was what they wanted.</p>
<p>Blount has endeavoured to shift the responsibility for the outbreak
of hostilities to the United States by claiming that certain words
italicized by him in what he calls the &ldquo;Benevolent Assimilation
Proclamation&rdquo; were necessarily, to the Insurgents,
&ldquo;fighting words.&rdquo; The expressions referred to have to do
with the establishment of United States sovereignty and the exercise of
governmental control in the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>These words were not &ldquo;fighting words,&rdquo; the Insurgent
policy being, as I have shown by the records, to consider the
acceptance of a protectorate or of annexation in the event that it did
not prove possible to negotiate absolute independence, or probable that
the American troops could be driven from the islands.</p>
<p>The growing confidence of the Insurgents in their ability to whip
the cowardly Americans, rather than any fixed determination on their
part to push a struggle for independence to the bitter end, led to
their attack. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=

real, effective government throughout the archipelago during the
interim between his return and the outbreak of hostilities with the
United States.</p>
<p>In summarizing conditions on September 15, 1898, Judge Blount
says:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4814src" href="#xd26e4814" name=
"xd26e4814src">1</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Absolute master of all Luzon outside Manila at
this time, with complete machinery of government in each province for
all matters of justice, taxes, and police, an army of some 30,000 men
at his beck, and his whole people a unit at his back, Aguinaldo
formally inaugurated his permanent government&mdash;permanent as
opposed to the previous provisional government&mdash;with a
Constitution, Congress, and Cabinet, patterned after our own,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4820src" href="#xd26e4820" name="xd26e4820src">2</a>
just as the South American republics had done before him when they were
freed from Spain, at Malolos, the new capital.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He refers to our utter failure to understand &ldquo;what a
wonderfully complete &lsquo;going concern&rsquo; Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
government had become throughout the Philippine Archipelago before the
Treaty of Paris was signed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4829src"
href="#xd26e4829" name="xd26e4829src">3</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>He bases his claim as to the excellent state of public order in the
Insurgent territory at this time on a report of Paymaster W. E. Wilcox
and Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent of the United States Navy, who between
October 8 and November 20, 1898, made a long, rapid trip through
northern Luzon, traversing the provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac,
Pangasin&aacute;n, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, Cagayan, South
Ilocos and Union, in the order named, thence proceeding to Dagupan and
down the railroad through Pangasin&aacute;n, Tarlac, Pampanga and
Bulacan to Manila.</p>
<p>He says that these gentlemen found the authority of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government universally acknowledged, the country in a
state of perfect tranquillity and public order,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4837src" href="#xd26e4837" name="xd26e4837src">4</a> with
profound peace and freedom from brigandage and the like.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4840src" href="#xd26e4840" name=
"xd26e4840src">5</a></p>
<p>Now if it be true that Aguinaldo established complete machinery of
government throughout all of Luzon outside of Manila for all matters of
justice, taxes and police, so that life and property were safe and
peace, tranquillity and justice assured, we may well dispense with
quibbling as to whether the proper name was applied to such government.
But did he?</p>
<p>Let us examine with some care the history of the Wilcox-Sargent
trip, and see if we can gain further light from other sources relative
to the condition of public order in the territory which they
traversed.</p>
<p>I propose, for the most part, to let the captured Insurgent records
speak for themselves, as it is fair to assume that Insurgent officers
were at no pains to represent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>conditions as worse than they
really were. In view of the fragmentary character of these records, we
may also assume that the complete story would be still more interesting
and instructive than the one which I have been able to reconstruct.</p>

</div>
<p>Messrs. Sargent and Wilcox were almost everywhere hospitably
received, and were entertained with dinners and dances after the
inimitable fashion of the hospitable Filipino everywhere. They gained a
very favourable impression of the state of public order in the
provinces through which they passed for the reason that from the very
start their trip was strictly personally conducted. They saw exactly
what it was intended that they should see and very little more. Their
progress was several times interrupted for longer or shorter periods
without adequate explanation. We now know that on these occasions the
scenery so carefully prepared in advance for them had become a little
disarranged and needed to be straightened up. Facts which I will cite
show that most shocking and horrible events, of which they learned
nothing, were occurring in the territory through which they passed.</p>
<p>For a considerable time before their departure American visitors had
been carefully excluded from the Insurgent territory, but the Filipino
leaders decided to let these two men go through it to the end that they
might make as favourable a report as possible. How carefully the way
was prepared for American visitors is shown by the following
telegram:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">San Pedro, Macati</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;July 30, 1898.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Local Presidente of Pasig:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hereby informed that the Americans are going to your
town and they will ask your opinion [of what the people
desire.&mdash;Tr.] You should answer them that we want a republican
government. The same answer must be given throughout your
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(Signed) &ldquo;P&iacute;o Del Pilar,</p>
<p>&ldquo;General of the Second Zone.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4877src" href="#xd26e4877" name="xd26e4877src">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now General Pilar had an uncomfortable way of killing people who did
not obey his orders, and under the rules of the Insurgent government he
was abundantly justified in so doing. His suggestions as to what
visiting Americans should be told or shown would be likely to be
acceded to. Certainly this seems to have been the case in the present
instance, for on the same day General Noriel reported as
follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4883src" href="#xd26e4883" name=
"xd26e4883src">7</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;President R. G., Bacoor, from Gen. Noriel,
Pineda, July 30, 12.10 P.M.: I inform your excellency that some
commissioners of the American admiral are making investigations in the
region around Pasay as to the wishes and opinion of the people as to
the government. To-day I received a statement from some, giving the
answer: &lsquo;Free government under American protectorate [copy
mutilated, two or three words missing here] the
President.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blount quotes with approval Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s statement made
shortly after the return of Wilcox and Sargent that in his opinion
their report &ldquo;contains the most complete and reliable information
obtainable in regard to the present state of the northern part of Luzon
Island.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4892src" href="#xd26e4892"
name="xd26e4892src">8</a> This was true.</p>
<p>The admiral might have gone further and said that it contained
practically the only information then obtainable in regard to
conditions in the territory in question, but as I shall conclusively
show it was neither complete nor reliable.</p>
<p>Judge Blount in describing the experiences of Messrs. Wilcox and
Sargent na&iuml;vely makes the statement that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The tourists were provided at Rosales by order
of Aguinaldo with a military escort, &lsquo;which was continued by
relays all the way to Aparri.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4902src" href="#xd26e4902" name="xd26e4902src">9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It certainly was!</p>
<p>Very little Spanish was then spoken in Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela or
Cagayan. What opportunity had these two <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>men, ignorant as they
were of the native dialects, to learn the sinister facts as to what had
been and was occurring in the territory which they visited?</p>
<p>No one can fail to be delighted with Filipino hospitality, which was
lavishly bestowed upon them everywhere, and it is only natural that
they should have reported favourably upon what they saw. It was about
this time that an order was issued<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4915src"
href="#xd26e4915" name="xd26e4915src">10</a> that fronts of buildings
should be whitewashed, streets cleaned and fences repaired with a view
to showing every one, and especially travellers through the territory
of the Insurgents, that they were &ldquo;not opposed to a good such as
a refined and civilized people should have.&rdquo; Doubtless the report
of the two men from Dewey&rsquo;s fleet was made in the best of faith.
I will now endeavour to show what were some of the actual conditions in
the territory through which they passed.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<h3 class="main">Bulacan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They first visited Bulacan. They do not mention
hearing of the activities of a Chinaman named Ignacio Paua, who had
been given the rank of colonel by Aguinaldo and assigned the task of
extorting contributions for the revolution from his countrymen. In a
letter to Aguinaldo written on July 6, 1898, Paua states that he has
collected more than $1,000 from the Chinese of these small towns, but
asks for an order &ldquo;prohibiting the outrages that are being
committed against such merchants as are not our enemies.&rdquo; He
further says, &ldquo;When the contributions from the Chinamen of all
the pueblos shall have been completed I wish to publish a proclamation
forbidding any injury to the Chinamen and any interference with their
small business enterprises,&rdquo; and adds that &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>natives hereabouts themselves are the people who
are committing said abuses.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4925src"
href="#xd26e4925" name="xd26e4925src">11</a></p>
<p>Apparently Paua had no objection to the committing of outrages
against merchants that were the enemies of the cause, nor does he seem
to have objected to injury to Chinamen before contributions were
completed. His own methods were none too mild. On August 27, 1898,
General P&iacute;o del Pilar telegraphed Aguinaldo that five Insurgent
soldiers, under a leader supposed to be Paua, had entered the store of
a Chinaman, and tried to kidnap his wife, but had left on the payment
of $10 and a promise to pay $50 later, saying that they would return
and hang their fellow countryman if the latter amount was not
forthcoming.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4933src" href="#xd26e4933"
name="xd26e4933src">12</a></p>

services! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Pampanga</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our travellers next visited Pampanga. Here they
apparently overlooked the fact that Aguinaldo did not have &ldquo;his
whole people a unit at his back.&rdquo; The citizens of Macabebe seem
not to have approved of the Aguinaldo regime, for the Insurgent records
show that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Representatives of the towns of Pampanga
assembled in San Fernando on June 26, 1898, and under the presidency of
General Maximino Hizon agreed to yield him complete &lsquo;obedience as
military governor of the province and representative of the illustrious
dictator of these Philippine Islands.&rsquo; The town of Macabebe
refused to send any delegates to this gathering.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4948src" href="#xd26e4948" name=
"xd26e4948src">13</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be incidentally mentioned that Blount has passed somewhat
lightly over the fact that he himself during his army days commanded an
aggregation of sturdy citizens from this town, known as Macabebe
scouts, who diligently shot the Insurgents full of holes whenever they
got a chance. He incorrectly refers to them as a &ldquo;tribe or
clan.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4953src" href="#xd26e4953"
name="xd26e4953src">14</a> It is absurd to call them a tribe. They are
merely the inhabitants of a town which has long been at odds with the
neighbouring towns of the province.</p>
<p>Things had come to a bad pass in Pampanga when its head wrote that
the punishment of beating people in the plaza and tying them up so that
they would be exposed to the full rays of the sun should be stopped. He
argued that such methods would not lead the people of other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>nations to believe that the reign of liberty,
equality and fraternity had begun in the Philippines.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4960src" href="#xd26e4960" name="xd26e4960src">15</a></p>
<p>When it is remembered that persons tied up and exposed to the full
rays of the sun in the Philippine lowlands soon die, in a most
uncomfortable manner, we shall agree with the head of this province
that this custom has its objectionable features!</p>

<h3 class="main">Tarlac</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the failure of Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent to
learn of the relations between the Tagalogs of Macabebe and their
neighbours, or of the fact that people were being publicly tortured in
Pampanga, is perhaps not to be wondered at under the circumstances, it
is hard to see how they could have failed to hear something of the
seriously disturbed conditions in Tarlac if they so much as got off the
train there.</p>
<p>On August 24 the commissioner in charge of elections in that
province asked for troops to protect him, in holding them in the town
of Urdaneta, against a party of two thousand men of the place, who were
going to prevent them.</p>
<p>On September 22 the secretary of the interior ordered that the
requirements of the decree of June 18, establishing municipal
governments, should be strictly complied with, as in many of the towns
&ldquo;the inhabitants continue to follow the ancient methods by which
the friars exploited us at their pleasure and which showed their great
contempt for the law.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4974src" href=

<p>The following letter to Aguinaldo, from Juan Nepomuceno,
Representative from Tarlac, speaks for itself as to conditions in that
province on December 27, 1898, shortly after the American travellers
passed through it on their return:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I regret exceedingly being compelled to report
to you that since Sunday the 25th instant scandalous acts have been
going on in the Province of Tarlac, which I represent. On the night of
the Sunday mentioned the entire family of the Local Chief of Bamban was
murdered, and his house and warehouse were burned. Also the Tax
Commissioner and the Secretary, Fabian Ignacio, have been murdered.
Last night Se&ntilde;or Jacinto Vega was kidnapped at the town of
Gerona; and seven travellers were murdered at O&rsquo;Donnel, which
town was pillaged, as well as the barrio of Matayumtayum of the town of
La Paz. On that day various suspicious parties were seen in the town of
Pa&ntilde;ique and in the same barrio, according to reliable reports
which I have just received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this general demoralization of the province, according to
the information which I have obtained, is due to the fact that the
province is dissatisfied with the Provincial Chief, Se&ntilde;or
Alfonso Ramos, and with Major Manuel de Le&oacute;n; for this is
substantiated by the fact that all the events described occurred since
last Sunday, when Se&ntilde;or Alfonso Ramos returned, to take charge
of the Office of Provincial President, after having been detained for
several days in this town. Wherefore, I believe that in order to
restore tranquillity in the province, consideration be given to various
documents that have been presented to the Government and to the
standing Committee of Justice; and that there be removed from office
Se&ntilde;or Alfonso Ramos, as well as said Se&ntilde;or Manuel de
Le&oacute;n, who has no prestige whatever in this province. Moreover on
the day when fifty-four soldiers of the command deserted, he himself
left for San Fernando, Pampanga.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4992src" href="#xd26e4992" name="xd26e4992src">17</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On November 30, 1898, General Macabulos sent Aguinaldo a
telegram<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4997src" href="#xd26e4997" name=
"xd26e4997src">18</a> from which it evidently appears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>that
there was an armed uprising in Tarlac which he was endeavouring to
quell and that he hoped for early success. Apparently, however, his
efforts to secure tranquillity were not entirely successful, for on
December 18 he telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In a telegram dated to-day Lieut. Paraso,
commanding a detachment at Camilin, informs me that last night his
detachment was attacked by Tulisanes (robbers). The fire lasted four
hours without any casualties among our men. This afternoon received
another from the captain commanding said detachment, informing me of
the same, and that nothing new has occurred. The people of the town
await with anxiety the result of the charges they have made, especially
against the local president and the justice of the peace, the original
of which I sent to your high authority.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5010src" href="#xd26e5010" name="xd26e5010src">19</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the police machinery was not working quite smoothly when a
detachment of Insurgent troops could be kept under fire for four hours
by a robber band, and perhaps the attacking party were not all
&ldquo;robbers.&rdquo; Soldiers do not ordinarily carry much to
steal.</p>
<p>We obtain some further information from the following telegram of
December 27, 1898, sent by the secretary of the interior to the
President of the Revolutionary Government:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. According to reports no excitement
except in Bangbang, Tarlac, which at 12 A.M., 25th, was attacked by
Tulisanes [bandits or robbers,&mdash;D.C.W.]. The local presidente with
his patrols arrested six of them. On continuing the pursuit he met in
Talacon a party too large to attack. At 7 A.M. of the 26th the town was
again attacked by criminals, who killed the tax collector, and others
who burnt some houses, among them that of the local presidente, and his
stables, in which he lost two horses. I report this for your
information.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5020src" href=
"#xd26e5020" name="xd26e5020src">20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>Evidently tax collectors were not popular in Tarlac.</p>
<p>Still further light is shed on the situation by a telegram from the
secretary of the interior to Aguinaldo, dated December 28,
1898:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;According to my information the excitement in
Tarlac increases. I do not think that the people of the province would
have committed such barbarities by themselves. For this reason the
silence of General Macabulos is suspicious; to speak frankly, it
encourages the rebels. Some seven hundred of them, with one hundred and
fifty rifles, entered Pa&ntilde;ique, seized the arms of the police,
the town funds, and attacked the houses of the people. I report this
for your information. All necessary measures will be
taken.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5032src" href="#xd26e5032"
name="xd26e5032src">21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note also the following from the secretary of the interior, under
date of December 27, 1898, to Aguinaldo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I have just learned that not only in Bangbang,
but also in Gerona, Onell, and other places in Tarlac, men have been
assaulted by numerous Tulisanes, armed with rifles and bolos, who are
killing and capturing the inhabitants and attacking travellers, robbing
them of everything they have. The President should declare at once that
that province is in state of siege, applying martial law to the
criminals. That&mdash;(remainder missing).&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5041src" href="#xd26e5041" name="xd26e5041src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The secretary of agriculture took a more cheerful view of the
situation. Under date of December 28 he telegraphed Aguinaldo as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The events in Bangbang, Tarlac Province,
according to a witness here worthy of credit, have arisen from an
attempt to procure vengeance on the local presidente, and robbery of
Chinese shops. Hence they are without political importance. The tax
collector killed, and a countryman servant of the local presidente
wounded. They burnt two houses of the local presidente, a stable, and a
warehouse for sugar-cane.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5050src"
href="#xd26e5050" name="xd26e5050src">23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously the robbery of Chinese shops and the killing of a few
individuals was at first considered by the secretary of agriculture to
be without political importance. Evidently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>he
changed his mind, however, for on the same day, December 28, 1898, he
telegraphed Aguinaldo as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I think it necessary to send Aglipay<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5061src" href="#xd26e5061" name=
"xd26e5061src">24</a> to quiet Tarlac. Send for him. If you desire, I
will go to Tarlac to investigate the causes of the disorders, in order
to find a remedy for them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5064src"
href="#xd26e5064" name="xd26e5064src">25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage of events Aguinaldo was summoned to Malolos by a
telegram from Mabini under date of December 29, which reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. You must come here immediately.
Tr&iacute;as is sick. We can come to no decision in regard to the
Tarlac matter. Cannot constitute a government without
you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5072src" href="#xd26e5072" name=
"xd26e5072src">26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The measures which were actually taken are set forth in another
telegram of the same date from the secretaries of war and interior to
Aguinaldo, which reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We have sent civil and military commissioners
to Tarlac; among them the Director of War and persons of much moral
influence, in order to stifle the disturbances. The necessary
instructions have been given them and full powers for the purpose, and
as far as possible to satisfy the people. Have also sent there six
companies of soldiers with explicit instructions to their commander to
guard only the towns, and make the people return to a peaceful life,
using a policy of attraction for the purpose.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5081src" href="#xd26e5081" name="xd26e5081src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us hope that the commander was able to attract the people with
his six companies of soldiers, and make them return to a peaceful
life.</p>
<p>Still further light is thrown on the situation in Tarlac by the
following extract from &ldquo;<span lang="es">Episodios de la
Revolucion Filipina</span>&rdquo; by Padre Joaquin D. Duran, an
Augustinian priest, Manila, 1901, page 71:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At that period the Filipinos, loving order,
having been deceived of the emancipation promise, changed by the
Katip&uacute;nan into crimes and attacks on the municipality of the
pueblos, discontent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>broke out in all parts, and, although
latent in some provinces, in that of Tarlac was materialized in an
ex-sergeant of the late Spanish civil guard. A valorous and determined
man, he lifted up his flag against that of Aguinaldo. One hundred
rifles were sufficient to terrorize the inhabitants of said province,
crushing the enthusiastic members of the revolutionary
party&#8202;&hellip;. Having taken possession of four towns, Pecheche
would have been everywhere successful if ambition and pride had not
directed his footsteps. In January, 1899, the Aguinaldista commander of
Tarlac province, afraid that his whole province would espouse the cause
of the sergeant, attempted by every means in his power to interrupt his
career, not hesitating to avail himself of crime to destroy the
influence of Pecheche with the many people who had been incensed by the
Katip&uacute;nan and had in turn become firm partisans of the Guards of
Honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ilocano Tranquilino Pagarigan, local presidente at that
time of Camiling, served as an admirable instrument for this
purpose&#8202;&hellip;. Pecheche was invited to a solemn festivity
organized by Tranquilino, who pretended to recognize him as his chief,
and rendering himself a vassal by taking an oath to his flag. He
accepted the invitation, and after the mass which was celebrated went
to a meal at the convent, where, after the meal was over, the members
of the K.K.K. surrounded Pecheche and 10 of his officers and killed
them with bolos or tied them and threw them out of the windows and down
the staircase. Some priests were held captive in the building where
this took place and were informed of what had taken place immediately
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This extract shows how easy it then was for any man of determination
to acquire a following, especially if he could dispose of a few rifles.
It also gives an excellent idea of the methods employed by the
Insurgents in dealing with those who opposed their rule.</p>
<p>General Fred D. Grant once told me, with much amusement, of an
interesting experience during a fight on Mt. Arayat in Pampanga. His
men took a trench and captured some of its occupants. Several of these
were impressed as guides and required to show the attacking forces the
locations of other trenches. At first they served unwillingly, but
presently became enthusiastic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"
href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>and rushed the works of their
quondam fellow-soldiers in the van of the American attack. Finally they
begged for guns. Grant added that he could start from Bacolor for San

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And now we come to Pangasin&aacute;n, the most
populous province of Luzon, and the third in the Philippines in number
of inhabitants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In July, 1898, the officer in Dagupan wrote to
the commanding general of Tarlac Province that he would like to know
whom he was required to obey, as there were so many officials of all
ranks who gave him orders that it was impossible for him to know where
he stood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5114src" href="#xd26e5114"
name="xd26e5114src">28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a letter dated August 17, 1898, to Aguinaldo, Benito Legarda
complained that a bad impression had been produced by the news from
Dagupan that when the Insurgents entered there, after many outrages
committed upon the inmates of a girls&rsquo; school, every officer had
carried off those who suited him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5119src"
href="#xd26e5119" name="xd26e5119src">29</a></p>
<p>What should we say if United States troops entered the town of
Wellesley and raped numerous students at the college, the officers
subsequently taking away with them the young ladies who happened to
suit them? Yet things of this sort hardly caused a ripple in the
country then under the Insurgent flag, and I learned of this particular
incident by accident, although I have known Legarda for years.</p>
<p>I quote the following general description of conditions in
Pangasin&aacute;n from a letter addressed by Cecilio Ap&oacute;stol to
General Aguinaldo on July 6, 1898:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;You probably know that in the Province of
Pangasin&aacute;n, of one of the towns in which your humble servant is
a resident, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>the Spanish flag through our good fortune has
not flown here for the past few months, since the few Spaniards who
lived here have concentrated in Dagupan, a place not difficult of
attack, as is said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is what is going on in this Province&rdquo; There
exist here two Departmental Governments, one calling itself that of
Northern Luz&oacute;n and of which Don Vicente del Prado is the
President, and the other which calls itself that of Northern and
Central Luz&oacute;n, presided over by Don Juliano Paraiso. Besides
these two gentlemen, there are two governors in the province(!) one
Civil Political Military, living in Lingayen, named Don Felipe J.
Bartolom&eacute;, and another living in Real Guerrero, a town of Tayug,
named Don Vicente Estrella. And in addition there are a large number of
Administrators, Inspectors, Military Judges, Generals, &hellip; they
cannot be counted. It is a pandemonium of which even Christ, who
permits it, cannot make anything. Indeed, the situation is
insupportable. It reminds me of the schism in the middle ages when
there were two Popes, both legitimate, neither true. Things are as
clear as thick chocolate, as the Spaniards say. In my poor opinion,
good administration is the mother-in-law of disorder, since disorder is
chaos and chaos produces nothing but confusion, that is to say,
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had an opportunity, through the kindness of a friend,
to read the decree of that Government, dated June 18th, of the present
year, and the accompanying &lsquo;Instructions for the government of
towns and provinces.&rsquo; Article 9 of the said decree says that the
Superior Government will name a commissioner for each province with the
special duty of establishing there the organization set forth in the
decree. Very well so far: which of the so-called Presidents of Northern
or of Northern and Central Luz&oacute;n is the commissioner appointed
by that government to establish the new organization in that province?
Are military commanders named by you for Pangasin&aacute;n? I would be
very much surprised if either of them could show his credentials. Aside
from these, the fact remains that in those instructions no mention is
made of Presidents of Departments, there is a manifest contradiction in
their jurisdictions, since while one calls himself president of a
Departmental Government, of Northern Luz&oacute;n, the other governs
the Northern and Central portion of the Island, according to the seals
which they use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, nevertheless, a person calling himself the General
Administrator of the Treasury and the said Governor of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>Province, both of whom live in Tayug, came to
this town when the Spaniards voluntarily abandoned it and gathered all
the people of means, and drew up an act of election, a copy of which is
attached. From it you will see how this organization violates the
provisions of the decree of the 18th of June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another item: They got up a contract with the people of means
of this town, and did the same thing in the other towns, in which
contract they exact from us $1250 which they call contributions of war
(see document No. 2 attached). Among the doubtful powers of these
gentlemen is the one to exact these sums included?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they express orders from that Government?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps these blessed gentlemen&mdash;they are high flyers
there is no doubt about that,&mdash;have struck the clever idea of
calling themselves generals, governors, etc., in order to enjoy a
certain prestige and to give a certain color of legality to their
acts&mdash;this, although they don&rsquo;t know an iota of what they
are doing. But what I am sure of, and many other men also, is that
there is no order, that here there is not a single person in authority
whom to obey. This superfluity of rulers will finally lead to strained
relations between them and the towns of this province will end by
paying the piper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we poor ignorant creatures in so far as the republican
form of government is concerned, in order to avoid worse evils took
them at their word, obeyed them like automatons, hypnotized by the
title of &lsquo;Insurgents&rsquo; which they applied to themselves. But
when I had an opportunity to read the said decree, doubts were forced
upon me, I began to suspect&mdash;may God and they pardon me&mdash;that
they were trying to impose upon us nicely, that, shielded by the motto,
&lsquo;have faith in and submit to the will of the country&rsquo; they
came to these towns &lsquo;for business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to dissipate this doubt, in order to do away with
abuses, if there are abuses, I made up my mind to send you this account
of the condition of things here. I flatter myself that when you learn
of the lamentable situation of this province, you will soon deign to
take steps to establish order, because thereon depends the tranquillity
of Pangasinan and in the end a strict compliance with your superior
orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no limit to the thanks of the people of this
province if their petitions secure favourable consideration and an
immediate response from the high patriotism and honourable standpoint
of the Supreme Dictator of the Philippines.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<p>It will be noted that the picture thus drawn by Se&ntilde;or
Ap&oacute;stol differs in certain important particulars from that
painted in such engaging colours by Judge Blount.</p>
<p>In September, 1898, the civil governor of Pangasin&aacute;n had to
have an escort of troops in passing through his province.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5164src" href="#xd26e5164" name=
"xd26e5164src">31</a></p>
<p>On November 20, 1898, the head of the town of San Manuel wrote the
provincial governor that his people could no longer support the troops
quartered on them, as the adherents of the Katip&uacute;nan had burned
or stolen all of their property.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5169src"
href="#xd26e5169" name="xd26e5169src">32</a></p>
<p>The sum total of Blount&rsquo;s description of affairs in this, the
most populous province of Luz&oacute;n, is derived from the narrative
of Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent and reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In Pangasin&aacute;n &lsquo;the people were all
very respectful and polite and offered the hospitality of their
homes.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5179src" href=
"#xd26e5179" name="xd26e5179src">33</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubtless true, but as a summary of conditions perhaps a trifle
sketchy.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nueva Ecija was the next province visited by Wilcox
and Sargent. They have failed to inform us that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In December, 1899, certain men charged with
being members of this society [Guards of Honour] were interrogated in
Nueva Ecija as to their purposes. One of those questioned
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;That their purpose was one day, the date being
unknown to the deponent, when the Ilocanos of Batac came, to rise up in
arms and kill the Tag&aacute;los, both private individuals and public
employees, excepting those who agreed to the former, for the reason
that honours were granted only to the Tag&aacute;los, and but few to
the Ilocanos.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5194src"
href="#xd26e5194" name="xd26e5194src">34</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blount has assured us that the Filipinos were a unit at
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s back and were and are an united people, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>here are the Ilocanos of Nueva Ecija spoiling
his theory by remembering that they are Ilocanos and proposing to kill
whom? Not certain individual Filipinos, who might have offended them,
but the Tag&aacute;logs!</p>
<p>That there were other troubles in Nueva Ecija is shown by the
following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On January 7, 1899, the commissioner of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s treasury sent to collect contributions of war in
Nueva Ecija Province reported that the company stationed in San Isidro
had become guerillas under command of its officers and opposed his
collections, stating that they were acting in compliance with orders
from higher authority.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5206src" href=

<h2 class="main">Insurgent Rule in the Cagayan Valley</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nueva Vizcaya is drained by the Mag&aacute;t River, a
branch of the Cagayan. While the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan
constitute the Cagayan valley proper, Blount includes Nueva Vizcaya in
the territory covered by this designation, and for the purpose of this
discussion I will follow his example.</p>
<p>Especial interest attaches to the history of Insurgent rule, in the
Cagayan valley, as above defined, for the reason that Blount himself
served there as a judge of the court of first instance. He
says:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5221src" href="#xd26e5221" name=
"xd26e5221src">1</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The writer is perhaps as familiar with the
history of that Cagayan valley as almost any other American.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was. For his action in concealing the horrible conditions which
arose there under Insurgent rule, with which he was perfectly familiar,
and in foisting on the public the account of Messrs. Wilcox and
Sargent, as portraying the conditions which actually existed there, I
propose to arraign him before the bar of public opinion. In so doing I
shall consider these conditions at some length. We have much
documentary evidence concerning them in addition to that furnished by
the Insurgent records, although the latter quite sufficiently
demonstrate many of the more essential facts.</p>
<p>In describing the adventures of Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent in this
region, Judge Blount says:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5232src" href=
"#xd26e5232" name="xd26e5232src">2</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;There<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5240src" href=
"#xd26e5240" name="xd26e5240src">3</a> they were met by Simeon Villa,
military commander of Isabela province, the man who was chief of staff
to Aguinaldo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>afterwards, and was captured by General Funston
along with Aguinaldo in the spring of 1901.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The facts as to Villa&rsquo;s career in the Cagayan valley are
especially worthy of note as they seem to have entitled him, in the
opinion of his superiors, to the promotion which was afterward accorded
him. He was an intimate friend of Aguinaldo and later accompanied him
on his long flight through northern Luzon.</p>
<p>On August 10, 1898, Colonel Daniel Tirona, a native of Cavite
Province and one of the intimates of Aguinaldo, was ordered to proceed
to Aparri in the Insurgent steamer <i>Filipinas</i> and establish the
revolutionary government in northern Luzon. In doing this he was to
hold elections for office-holders under Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government
and was authorized to approve or disapprove the results, his action
being subject to subsequent revision by Aguinaldo. His forces were
composed of four companies armed with rifles.</p>
<p>Tirona reached Aparri on August 25 and promptly secured the
surrender of the Spaniards there.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by Simeon Villa, the man under discussion, and by
Colonel Leyba, who was also very close to Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>Abuse of the Spanish prisoners began at once. It is claimed that the
governor of North Ilocos, who was among those captured, was grossly
mistreated.</p>
<p>Taylor briefly summarizes subsequent events as follows:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5262src" href="#xd26e5262" name=
"xd26e5262src">4</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Whatever the treatment of the Spanish governor
of Ilocos may really have been, there is testimony to show that some of
the other prisoners, especially the priests, were abused and outraged
under the direction of S. Villa and Colonel Leyba, both of whom were
very close to Aguinaldo. Some of the Spanish civil officials were put
in stocks and beaten, and one of the officers who had surrendered at
Aparri was tortured to death. This was done with the purpose of
extorting money from them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>for it was believed that they had
hidden funds in place of turning them over. All the Spaniards were
immediately stripped of everything they had. The priests were subjected
to a systematic series of insults and abuse under the direction of
Villa in order to destroy their influence over the people by degrading
them in their eyes. It was for this that they were beaten and exposed
naked in the sun; and other torture, such as pouring tile wax of
burning candles into their eyes, was used to make them disclose where
they had hidden church vessels and church funds. The testimony of a
friar who suffered these outrages is that the great mass of the people
saw such treatment of their parish priests with horror, and were
present at it only through fear of the organized force of the
Katip&uacute;nan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s statement is mildness itself in view of the
well-established facts.</p>
<p>The question of killing the Spanish prisoners, including the friars,
had previously been seriously considered,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5275src" href="#xd26e5275" name="xd26e5275src">5</a> but it was
deemed wiser to keep most of the friars alive, extort money from them
by torture, and offer to liberate them in return for a large cash
indemnity, or for political concessions. Day after day and week after
week Villa presided at, or himself conducted, the torture of ill-fated
priests and other Spaniards who fell into his hands. Even Filipinos
whom he suspected of knowing the where-abouts of hidden friar money did
not escape.</p>
<p>The following information relative to the conduct of the Insurgents
in the Cagayan valley is chiefly taken from manuscript copy of <i lang=
"es">&ldquo;Historia de la Conquista de Cagayan por los Tagalos
Revolucionarios,&rdquo;</i> in which the narratives of certain captured
friars are transcribed and compiled by Father Julian Malumbres of the
Dominican Order.</p>
<p>The formal surrender of Aparri occurred on August 26. Tirona, his
officers and his soldiers, promptly pillaged the
<i>convento</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5291src" href="#xd26e5291"
name="xd26e5291src">6</a> The officers left the Bishop of Vigan ten
pesos, but the soldiers subsequently took them away from him. Wardrobes
and trunks were broken <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>open; clocks, shoes, money,
everything was carried off. Even personal papers and prayer-books were
taken from some of the priests, many of whom were left with absolutely
nothing save the few remaining clothes in which they stood.</p>
<p>On the same day Villa, accompanied by Victa and Rafael
Perea,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5298src" href="#xd26e5298" name=
"xd26e5298src">7</a> went to the <i>convento</i> and told the priests
who were imprisoned there that their last hour had come. He shut all of
them except the bishop and five priests in a room near the church, then
separated the Augustinians, Juan Zallo, Gabino Olaso, Fidel Franco,
Mariano Rodriguez, and Clemente Hidalgo, from the others and took them
into the lower part of the <i>convento</i> where he told them that he
intended to kill them if they did not give him more money. The priests
told him that they had given all they had, whereupon he had their arms
tied behind their backs, kicked them, struck them and whipped them with
rattans.</p>
<p>Father Zallo was thrown on his face and savagely beaten. Meanwhile
two shots were fired over the heads of the others and a soldier called
out &ldquo;One has fallen,&rdquo; badly frightening the priests who had
remained shut in the room. Villa then returned with soldiers to this
room, ordered his men to load, and directed that one priest step
forward to be shot. Father Mariano Ortiz complied with this request,
asking that he be the first victim. Villa, however, contented himself
with threatening him with a revolver and kicking and striking him until
he fell to the floor. He was then beaten with the butts of guns.</p>
<p>Father Jos&eacute; Vazquez, an old man of sixty years, who had
thrown some money into a privy to keep it from falling into the hands
of the Insurgents, was stripped and compelled to recover it with his
bare hands, after which he was kicked, and beaten with rattans.</p>
<p>Father Aquilino Garc&iacute;a was unmercifully kicked and beaten to
make him give up money, and this sort of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>thing continued until
Villa, tired out with the physical exertion involved in assaulting
these defenceless men, departed, leaving his uncompleted task to
others, who continued it for some time.</p>
<p>The net result to the Insurgents of the sacking of the
<i>convento</i> and of the tortures thus inflicted was approximately
$20,000 gold in addition to the silver, bank notes, letters of credit,
jewels, etc., which they obtained.</p>
<p>On September 5 Villa had Fathers Juan Recio and Buenaventura Macia
given fifty blows each, although Father Juan was ill.</p>
<p>Villa then went to Lalloc, where other priests were imprisoned. On
September 6 he demanded money of them, causing them to be kicked and
beaten. Father Angel was beaten in an especially cruel manner for the
apparent purpose of killing him, after which he was thrust into a
privy. Father Isidro Fernandez was also fearfully abused. Stripped of
his habit, and stretched face down on the floor, he was horribly
beaten, and was then kicked, and struck with the butt of a revolver on
the forehead.</p>
<p>A little later the priests were offered their liberty for a million
dollars, which they were of course unable to furnish. Meanwhile the
torture continued from time to time.</p>
<p>On August 30 Tuguegarao was taken by the Insurgents without
resistance. Colonel Leyba promptly proceeded to the <i>convento</i> and
demanded the money of the friars as spoil of war. He found only eight
hundred pesos in the safe. Father Corujedo was threatened with death if
he did not give more. Other priests were threatened but not tortured at
this time. The prisoners in the jail were liberated, but many of them
had promptly to be put back again because of the disorder which
resulted, and that same evening Leyba was obliged to publish a notice
threatening robbers with death.</p>
<p>At midnight on September 3 Father Corujedo was taken from the
<i>convento</i> by Captain Diego and was again <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>asked for money. Replying that he had no more to
give, he was beaten with the hilt of a sabre and stripped of his habit,
preparatory to being executed. A mock sentence of death was pronounced
on him and he was placed facing to the west to be shot in the back.
Diego ordered his soldiers to load, adding, &ldquo;When I count three
all fire,&rdquo; but the fatal count was not completed. Three priests
from Alcala were given similar treatment.</p>
<p>The troubles of the priests imprisoned at Tuguegarao were
sufficiently great, but they were augmented a thousand fold when Villa
arrived on September 11. He came to the building where they were
imprisoned, bearing a revolver, a sabre and a great quantity of
rattans. He ordered the priests into the corner of the room in which
they were confined, and beat those who did not move quickly enough to
suit him. He threatened them with a very rigorous examination, at the
same time assuring them that at Aparri he had hung up the bishop until
blood flowed from his mouth and his ears, and that he would do the same
with them if they did not tell him where they had their money hidden.
There followed the usual rain of kicks and blows, a number of the
priests being obliged to take off their habits in order that they might
be punished more effectively.</p>
<p>Fathers Calixto Prieto and Daniel Gonzales, professors in
educational institutions, he ordered beaten because they were
friars.</p>
<p>Fathers Corujedo and Caddedila were beaten, kicked and insulted.
Both were gray-haired old men and the latter was at the time very weak,
and suffering from a severe attack of asthma. Father Pedro Vincente was
also brutally beaten.</p>
<p>The following is the description given by an eye-witness of
conditions at Tuguegarao:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Even the Indios of Cagayan complained and were
the victims of looting and robbery on the part of the soldiery. So
lacking in discipline and so demoralized was that army that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>according to the confession of a prominent
Filipino it was of imperative necessity to disarm them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5352src" href="#xd26e5352" name="xd26e5352src">8</a>
On the other hand we saw with real astonishment that instead of warlike
soldiers accustomed to battle they were nearly all raw recruits and
apprentices. From an army lacking in discipline, and lawless, only
outrages, looting and all sorts of savagery and injustice were to be
expected. Witnesses to their demoralization are, aside from the natives
themselves who were the first to acknowledge it, the Chinese merchants
whose losses were incalculable; not a single store or commercial
establishment remained that was not looted repeatedly. As to the
Spaniards it goes without saying because it is publicly known, that
between soldiers and officers they despoiled them to their
heart&rsquo;s content, without any right except that of brute force, of
everything that struck their fancy, and it was of no avail to complain
to the officers and ask for justice, as they turned a deaf ear to such
complaints. At Tuguegarao they looted in a manner never seen before,
like Vandals, and it was not without reason that a prominent Filipino
said, in speaking to a priest: &lsquo;Vandalism has taken possession of
the place.&rsquo; These acts of robbery were generally accompanied by
the most savage insults; it was anarchy, as we heard an eye-witness
affirm, who also stated that no law was recognized except that of
danger, and the vanquished were granted nothing but the inevitable duty
of bowing with resignation to the iniquitous demands of that soulless
rabble, skilled in crime.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Villa now set forth for Isabela. Meanwhile the jailer of the priests
proceeded to steal their clothes, including shirts, shoes and even
handkerchiefs. Isabela was taken without resistance on September 12.
Dimas Guzman<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5361src" href="#xd26e5361"
name="xd26e5361src">9</a> swore to the priests on his life that he
would work without rest to the end that all friars and all Spaniards
might be respected, but he perjured himself.</p>

</div>
<p>On September 12 Villa and others entered the town of Cabagan Viejo,
where Villa promptly assaulted Father Segundo Rodriguez, threatening
him with a revolver, beating him unmercifully, insulting him in every
possible way and robbing him of his last cent. After the bloody
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>scene was over he sacked the <i>convento</i>,
even taking away the priests&rsquo; clothes.</p>
<p>Villa also cruelly beat a Filipino, Quintin Agansi, who was taking
care of money for masses which the priests wished to save from the
Insurgents.</p>
<p>After Father Segundo had suffered torture and abuse for two hours he
was obliged to start at once on a journey to Auitan. The suffering
priest, after being compelled to march through the street shouting
&ldquo;Vivas!&rdquo; for the Republic and Aguinaldo, spent the night
without a mouthful of food or a drink of water.</p>
<p>Father Deogracias Garc&iacute;a, a priest of Cabagan Nuevo, was
subjected to torture because he had sent to Hongkong during May a
letter of credit for $5000 which belonged to the Church. Villa and
Leyba entered his <i>convento</i> and after beating him ordered his
hands and feet to be tied together, then passed a pole between them and
had him lifted from the ground, after which two great jars of water
were poured down his nose and throat without interruption.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5388src" href="#xd26e5388" name=
"xd26e5388src">10</a> In order to make the water flow through his nose
better, they thrust a piece of wood into the nasal passages until it
came out in his throat. From time to time the torture was suspended
while they asked him whether he would tell the truth as to where he had
concealed his money. This unfortunate priest was so sure he was going
to die that while the torture was in progress he received absolution
from a fellow priest. After the torture with water there followed a
long and cruel beating, and the unhappy victim was finally thrust into
a filthy privy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Father Calzada was assaulted by a group of soldiers and
badly beaten, after which he was let down into the filth of a privy,
first by the feet and afterwards by the head.</p>
<p>On the 14th a lieutenant with soldiers entered the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span><i>convento</i> of Tumauini and as usual
demanded money of the occupants, who gave him $80, all they had at the
time. This quantity not being satisfactory, a rope was sent for and the
hands of the two priests were tied while they were whipped, kicked and
beaten. They were, however, released when Father Bonet promised to get
additional money. They had a short respite until the arrival of Villa,
who still demanded more money of Father Blanco, and failing to get it
for the reason that the father had no more, leaped upon him and gave
him a dreadful beating, his companions joining in with whips, rattans
and the butts of guns. They at last left their victim stretched on the
ground almost dead. This priest showed the marks of his ill treatment
six months afterward. Not satisfied with this, Villa gave him the
so-called &ldquo;water cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile his followers had also beaten Father Bonet. Villa started
to do likewise but was too tired, having exhausted his energies on
Father Blanco. While the tortures were going on, the <i>convento</i>
was completely sacked. Father Blanco&rsquo;s library was thrown out of
the window.</p>
<p>Villa entered Ilagan on the 15th of September at 8 o&rsquo;clock at
night. Hastening to the <i>convento</i>, with a company of well-armed
soldiers, he had his men surround the three priests who awaited him
there, then summoned the local priest to a separate room and demanded
money. The priest gave him all he had. Not satisfied, Villa leaped upon
him, kicking him, beating him and pounding him with the butt of a gun.
Many of his associates joined in the disgraceful attack. The
unfortunate victim was then stripped of his habit, obliged to lie down
and received more than a hundred lashes. When he was nearly senseless
he was subjected to torture by water, being repeatedly lifted up when
filled with water, and allowed to fall on the floor. While some were
pouring water down his nose and throat, others spilled hot wax
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>on his face and head. The torment repeatedly
rendered the priest senseless, but he was allowed to recover from time
to time so that he might suffer when it was renewed.</p>
<p>The torturing of this unhappy man lasted for three hours, and the
horrible scene was immediately succeeded by another quite as bad. Villa
called Father Domingo Campo and, after taking from him the little money
that he had, ordered him stripped. He was then given numberless kicks
and blows from the butts of rifles and 150 lashes, after which he was
unable to rise. There followed the torture with water, on the pretext
that he had money hidden away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the houses of Spaniards and the shops of the Chinese were
completely sacked, and the men who objected were knocked down or cut
down with bolos. Numerous girls and women were raped.</p>
<p>On September 15 Leyba received notice of the surrender of Nueva
Vizcaya. I quote the following from the narrative above referred
to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Delfin&rsquo;s soldiers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5420src" href="#xd26e5420" name="xd26e5420src">11</a> were the
most depraved ever seen: their thieving instincts had no bounds; so
they had hardly entered Nueva Vizcaya when they started to give
themselves up furiously to robbery, looking upon all things as loot; in
the very shadow of these soldiers the province was invaded by a mob of
adventurous and ragged persons from Nueva Ecija; between the two they
picked Nueva Vizcaya clean. When they had grown tired of completely
shearing the unfortunate Vizcayan people, leaving them
poverty-stricken, they flew in small bands to the pueblos of Isabela,
going as far as Angadanan, giving themselves up to unbridled pillage of
the most unjust and disorderly kind. Some of these highwaymen demanded
money and arms from the priest of Angadanan, but Father Marciano
informed them &lsquo;that it could not be, as Leyba already knew what
he had and would be angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this very day the people of Nueva Vizcaya have been unable
to recover from the stupendous losses suffered by them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>as
regards their wealth and industries. How many curses did they pour
forth and still continue to level against the Katip&uacute;nan that
brought them naught but tribulations!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confirmation of these statements is found in the following brief but
significant passage from the Insurgent records:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At the end of December, 1898, when the military
commander of Nueva Vizcaya called upon the Governor of that province to
order the police of the towns to report to him as volunteers to be
incorporated in the army which was being prepared for the defence of
the country, the Governor protested against it and informed the
government that his attempt to obtain volunteers was in fact only a
means of disarming the towns and leaving them without protection
against the soldiers who did what they wanted and took what they wished
and committed every outrage without being punished for it by their
officers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5433src" href="#xd26e5433"
name="xd26e5433src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of the surrender of Nueva Vizcaya on Leyba and Villa is
thus described by Father Malumbres:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Mad with joy and swollen with pride Leyba and
company were like men who travelled flower-strewn paths, crowned with
laurels, and were acclaimed as victors in all the towns on their road,
their intoxication of joy taking a sudden rise when they came to
believe themselves kings of the valley. It was then that their delirium
reached its brimful measure and their treatment of those whom they had
vanquished began to be daily more cruel and inhuman. In Cagayan their
fear of the forces in Nueva Vizcaya kept them from showing such
unqualifiable excesses of cruelty and nameless barbarities, but the
triumph of the Katip&uacute;nan arms in Nueva Vizcaya completely broke
down the wall of restraint which somewhat repressed those sanguinary
executioners thirsting to fatten untrammelled on the innocent blood of
unarmed and defenceless men. From that melancholy time there began an
era of unheard of outrages and barbarous scenes, unbelievable were they
not proved by evidence of every description. The savage acts committed
in Isabela by the inhuman Leyba and Villa cannot possibly be painted
true to life and in all their tragic details. The blackest hues, the
most heartrending accents, the most vigorous language and the most
fulminating anathemas would be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181"
href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>a pale image of the truth,
and our pen cannot express with true ardour the terrifying scenes and
cruel torments brought about by such fierce chieftains on such
indefensive religious. It seems impossible that a fleshly heart could
hold so much wickedness, for these petty chiefs were veritable monsters
of cruelty who surpassed a Nero; men who were entire strangers to noble
and humane sentiments and who in appearance having the figure of a man
were in reality tigers roaring in desperation, or mad dogs who gnashed
their teeth in fury.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 18 Leyba continued his march, while Villa remained
behind at Ilagan to torture the prisoners who might be brought in from
Isabela.</p>
<p>On arrival at Gamut, Leyba at once entered the <i>convento</i> and
as usual immediately demanded money from the priests. Father Venancio
gave him all he had. He was nevertheless given a frightful whipping,
six persons holding him while others rained blows upon him. A
determined effort was made to force the priest to recant, and when this
failed Leyba leaped upon him, kicking and beating him. He then ordered
him thrown down face uppermost, and asked for a knife with the apparent
intention of mutilating him. He did not use the knife, however, but
instead, assisted by his followers, gave the unhappy priest another
terrific beating, even standing upon him and leaping up and down. The
priest was left unable to speak, and did not recover for months.</p>
<p>Later Leyba had torture by water applied to Father Gregorio Cabrero
and lay brother Venancio Aguinaco, while Father Sabanda was savagely
beaten.</p>
<p>On the 19th of September Father Miguel Garcia of Reina Mercedes was
horribly beaten in his <i>convento</i> by a captain sent there to get
what money he had.</p>
<p>In Cauayan, on September 20, Fathers Perez and Aguirrezabal were
beaten and compelled to give up money by five emissaries of Leyba, and
the latter priest was cut in the face with a sabre. The <i>convento</i>
was sacked. On the 25th Leyba arrived and after kicking and beating
Father Garcia compelled him to give up <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>$1700. He then
informed the priests that if it were not for Aguinaldo&rsquo;s orders
he would kill all the Spaniards.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th three priests and a Spaniard named Soto
arrived at Ilagan. The following is the statement of an eye-witness as
to what happened:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;They led the priests to the headquarters of the
commanding officer where the tyrant Villa, always eager to inflict
suffering on humanity, awaited them. The scene witnessed by the priests
obeisant to the cruel judge was horrifying in the extreme. Four lions
whose thirst for vengeance was extreme in all, threw themselves, blind
with fury, without a word and with the look of a basilisk, upon poor
Se&ntilde;or Soto giving him such innumerable and furious blows on head
and face that weary as he was from his past journey, the ill-treatment
received at Angadanan and weighted down by years, he was soon thrown
down by his executioners under the lintel of the door getting a
terrible blow on the head as he fell; even this did not satisfy nor
tame down those fierce-hearted men, who on the contrary continued with
their infamous work more furious than before, and their cruelty did not
flag on seeing their victim at their feet. They could have done no
worse had they been Sil&iacute;pan savages dancing in triumph around
the palpitating head cut from the body of some enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priests who witnessed this blood-curdling scene trembled
like the weak reed before the gale, waiting their turn to be tortured,
but God willed that cruel Villa should be content with the butchery
perpetrated upon unhappy Sr. Soto. Villa dismissed the priests after
despoiling them of their bags and clothes telling them, to torment
them: &lsquo;Go to the <i>convento</i> until the missing ones turn up
so that I may shoot you all together.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leyba entered Echague on September 22, promptly going to the
<i>convento</i> as usual and demanding money of the priest, Father
Mata. When the latter had given him all he had, he received three
terrific beatings at the hands of some twelve men armed with whips and
sticks, after which Leyba himself struck him with his fist and his
sabre. He was finally knocked down by a blow with the sabre and left
disabled. It took six months for him to recover. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shortly after Leyba&rsquo;s arrival in Nueva Vizcaya on the
afternoon of the 25th, five priests were summoned to Solano and there
abused in the usual fashion in an effort to extort money from them.
Only one escaped ill treatment and one was nearly killed.</p>
<p>Leyba now went to Bayombong to carry out the established programme
with the priests. There he found Governor Perez of Isabela, who had
taken with him certain government moneys and employed them to pay
salaries of soldiers and other employees. He insisted on the return of
the total amount and threatened to shoot Perez if it was not
forthcoming. The Spaniards of the vicinity subscribed $700 which they
themselves badly needed and saved him from being shot. The priests of
the place were then summoned to Leyba&rsquo;s quarters and were beaten
and tortured. One of them was thrown on the floor and beaten nearly to
death, Leyba standing meanwhile with his foot on the unfortunate
man&rsquo;s neck. Another was given six hundred lashes and countless
blows and kicks. Leyba stood on this man&rsquo;s neck also. When the
victim&rsquo;s back ceased to have any feeling, his legs were beaten.
Leyba terminated this period of diversion by kicking Father Diez in the
solar plexus and then mocking him as he lay gasping on the floor. That
afternoon one of the priests, so badly injured that he could not rise
unaided, was put on a horse and compelled to ride in the hot sun to
Solano.</p>

</div>
<p>Villa and Leyba had their able imitators, as is shown by the
following description of the torturing of Father Ceferino by Major
Delfin at Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, on September 27:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;They wished to give brave evidence of their
hate for the friar before Leyba left, and show him that they were as
brave as he when it came to oppressing and torturing the friar. This
tragedy began by Jimenez again asking Father Ceferino for the money.
The priest answered as he had done before. Then Jimenez started to talk
in Tagalog to the commanding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>officer and surely it was nothing
good that he told him, for suddenly Delfin left the bench and darting
fire from his eyes, fell in blind fury upon the defenceless priest;
what harsh words he uttered in Tagalog while he vented his fury on his
victim, striking him with his clenched fist, slapping him and kicking
him, I do not know, but the religious man fell at the feet of his
furious executioner who, being now the prey of the most stupendous
rage, could scarcely get his tongue to stutter and continued to kick
the priest, without seeing where he kicked him. Getting deeper and
deeper in the abyss and perhaps not knowing what he was about, this
petty chief made straight for a sabre lying on a table to continue his
bloody work. In the meantime the priest had risen to his feet and
awaited with resignation new torments which certainly were even worse
than the first, for he gave him so many and such hard blows with the
sabre that the blade was broken close to the hilt. This accident so
infuriated Delfin that he again threw himself upon the priest, kicking
him furiously and striking him repeatedly until he again threw him to
the ground, and not yet satisfied, his vengefulness led him to throw
himself upon his victim with the fury of a tiger after his prey,
beating him on the head with the hilt of the saber until the blood ran
in streams and formed pools upon the pavement. The priest, more dead
than alive, shuddered from head to foot, and appeared to be struggling
in a tremendous fight between life and death; he had hardly enough
strength to get his tongue to ask for God&rsquo;s mercy. At this most
critical juncture, and when it seemed as if death were inevitable, the
martyr received absolution from Father Diez, who witnessed the
blood-curdling picture with his heart pierced with grief at the sight
of the sufferings of his innocent brother, feeling as must the
condemned man preparing for death who sees the hours fly by with
vertiginous rapidity. The blood flowing from the wounds on the
priest&rsquo;s head appeared to infuriate and blind the heart of Delfin
who, rising from his victim&rsquo;s body, sped away to the armory in
the court house, seized a rifle, and came back furious to brain him
with the butt and finish killing the priest; but God willed to free his
servant from death at the hands of those cannibals, so that generous
Lieutenant Navarro interfered, took the rifle away from him and caught
Delfin by the arm, threatening him with some words spoken in Tagalog.
Then Navarro, to appease Delfin&rsquo;s anger, turned the priest over
with his face to the ground and gave him a few strokes with the bamboo,
and feigning anger and indignation, ordered him away. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who witnessed the horrible tragedy, the brutality of
the tyrant and the prostration of the friar were persuaded that the
latter would never survive his martyrdom. The religious man himself
holds it as a veritable portent that he outlived such a terrible trial;
but even this did not satisfy them as subsequently the Secretary again
called Father Ceferino to subject him to a further scrutiny, as
ridiculous as it was malicious, though it did not go beyond words or
insults.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Perez, the governor of Isabela, and Father Diez were
compelled to go to Ilagan. After they had arrived there on October 2d,
Villa proceeded to torture them. At the outset ten soldiers,
undoubtedly instructed beforehand, beat the governor down to the earth,
with the butts of their guns. Villa himself struck him three times in
the chest with the butt of a gun and Father Diez gave him absolution,
thinking he was dying. Father Diez was then knocked down repeatedly
with the butts of guns, being made to stand up promptly each time in
order that he might be knocked down again. Not satisfied with this,
Villa compelled the suffering priest to kneel before him and kicked him
in the nose, repeating the operation until he left him stretched on the
floor half-senseless with his nose broken. He next had both victims put
in stocks with their weight supported by their feet alone. While in
this position soldiers beat them and jumped onto them and one set the
governor&rsquo;s beard on fire with matches. Father Diez was kept in
the stocks four days. He was then sent to Tuguegarao in order that
personal enemies there might take vengeance on him, Villa bidding him
good-by with the following words: &ldquo;Go now to Tuguegarao and see
if they will finish killing you there.&rdquo; Se&ntilde;or Perez was
kept in the stocks eight days and it is a wonder that he did not
die.</p>
<p>Upon the 25th of September Villa went to the <i>convento</i> in
Ilagan prepared to torture the priests, but he succeeded in compelling
a number of them to sign indorsements in his favour on various letters
of credit payable by the Tabacalera Company and departed again in
fairly good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>humour, having done nothing worse than strike
one of them.</p>
<p>Later, however, on the pretext that Fathers Aguado and Labanda had
money hidden away, he determined to torture them with water. The first
to be tortured was Father Labanda. Villa had him taken to the prison
where the priest found his two faithful Filipino servants who had been
beaten cruelly and were then hanging from a beam, this having been done
in order to make them tell where his money was.</p>
<p>He was tied after the usual fashion and water poured down his nose
and throat. During the brief respites necessary in order to prevent his
dying outright he was cruelly beaten. They finally dragged him out of
the prison by the feet, his head leaving a bloody trail on the stones.
After he had been taken back to his companions, one of the men who had
tortured him came to beg his pardon, saying that he had been compelled
to do it by Villa.</p>
<p>Father Aguado was next tortured in one of the rooms of the
<i>convento</i>. Villa finished the day&rsquo;s work by announcing to
the band of priests that he would have them all shot the next day on
the plaza, and ordering them to get ready.</p>
<p>On the 29th the barbarities practised by this inhuman fiend reached
their climax in the torturing to death of Lieutenant Piera. The
following description gives some faint idea of one of the most
diabolical crimes ever committed in the Philippines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Villa&rsquo;s cruelty and sanguinary jeering
grew without let or hindrance from day to day; it seemed that this
hyena continually cudgelled his brains to invent new kinds of torture
and to jeer at the friars. On the night of the 29th of September the
diabolical idea occurred to him of giving the <i lang="fr">coup de
grace</i> to the prestige of the friars by making them pass through the
streets of Ilagan conducting and playing a band of music. He carried
out his nonsensical purpose by calling upon Father Diogracias to play
the big drum, and when this priest had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>started playing Villa
learned that Father Primo was a musician and could therefore play the
drum and lead the band with all skill, so he called upon Father Primo
to come forward, and with one thing and another this ridiculous
function was carried on until the late hours of the night.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;While these two priests were serenading Villa and his gang,
the most dreadful shrieks were heard from the jail, accompanied by
pitiful cries that would melt the coldest heart. The priests hearing
these echoes of sorrow and pain, and who did not know for what purpose
Fathers Deogracias and Primo had been separated from them, seemed to
recognize the voices of these two priests among the groans, believing
them to be cruelly tortured; for this reason they began to say the
rosary in order that the Most Holy Virgin might imbue them with
patience and fortitude in their martyrdom. Great was their surprise
when these priests returned saying that they had contented themselves
with merely making fun of them by obliging them to play the big drum
and lead the band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although this somewhat tempered their sorrow, a thorn
remained in their hearts, fearing that the moving lamentations and the
mortal groans came from the lips of some hapless Spaniard. This
fatidical presentiment turned out unfortunately to be a fact. The
victim sacrificed that melancholy night, still remembered with a
shudder by the priests, was Lieutenant Salvador Piera. This brave
soldier, who had made up his mind to die in the breach rather than
surrender the town of Aparri, was persuaded to capitulate only by the
prayers and tears of certain Spanish ladies who had been instructed to
do so by a man who should have been the first one to shoulder a rifle.
After having been harassed in Aparri he was taken to Tuguegarao at the
request of Esteban Quinta or Isidoro Maquigat, two artful filibusters
thirsting to revenge themselves on the Lieutenant, who during the time
of the Spanish government had justly laid his heavy hand upon them. In
the latter part of September they conducted him on foot and without any
consideration whatever to the capital of Isabela. In this town he was
at once placed in solitary confinement in one of the rooms of the
<i>convento</i> and allowed no intercourse with any one. The sin for
which they recriminated Piera was his having charged Dimas<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5543src" href="#xd26e5543" name=
"xd26e5543src">13</a> with being a filibuster, and their revengefulness
reached an incredible limit. The heartrending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>moans of this martyr to his duty still resound
in that <i>convento</i> converted into the scene of an orgy of blood.
The unfortunate man was heard to shout: &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,
for God&rsquo;s sake, have pity,&rsquo; and trustworthy persons tell
that under the strain of torture he would challenge them to fight in a
fair field by saying: &lsquo;I will fight alone against twenty of
you;&rsquo; but the cowardly torturers, a reproach to the Filipino
race, looked upon it as an amusement to glut their spite on a
defenceless man whose hands were tied. They had him strung up all night
with but insignificant refreshment and rest, sometimes being suspended
by his arms which finally became disjointed and useless, and at others
he was hung up by his feet, the blood rushing to his head and placing
him in imminent danger of sudden death. It was the intention of these
brutes to torture him as much as possible before killing him, just as a
member of the feline race plays with, tosses in the air and pirouettes
around the victim which falls into his claws. If to the torture of the
rope are added the blows with cudgels and the butts of rifles which
were frequently rained upon the victim it will be no surprise that
early on the morning of the 30th he was in the throes of death in the
midst of which the sufferer had just enough strength to say that he was
hungry and thirsty; then those cannibals (the heart is filled with fury
in setting forth such cruelty) cut a piece of flesh from the calf of
the dying man&rsquo;s leg and conveyed it to his mouth and instead of
water they gave him to drink some of his own urine. What savagery!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blood from the wound finished the killing of the fainting
Piera. The blood shed served to infuriate more the barbarous
executioners who in order to give the finishing stroke to the martyr,
as an unrivalled expression of their savage ferocity, thrust a red-hot
iron into his mouth and eyes. That same night these treacherous and
ferocious tyrants whose sin made them hate the light, buried the body
in the darkness of the night in a patch of cogon grass adjoining the
<i>convento</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piera&rsquo;s torture was by no means confined to this last night of
his life, as the following account of it shows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In the first days of this accursed month, while
the padres were bemoaning their fate in jail, a dark drama was being
enacted in the <i>convento</i>, whose hair-raising scenes would have
inspired terror to Montepiu himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Salvador Piera of the Guardia Civil, commanding
officer at Aparri, who, realizing that all resistance was useless,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>gave way to the persistent solicitations of
Spaniards and natives and surrendered that town on honourable terms,
which the Katip&uacute;nan forces did not respect after the
capitulation had been signed, was sent for by Villa, the military
authority of Isabela. Something terrible was going to happen as Piera
himself felt confident, for it is said that before leaving Aparri he
went to confession where he settled the important business of his
conscience in a Christian manner with a representative of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it turned out, for as soon as he arrived in Ilagan he
was taken to the <i>convento</i> and placed incomunicado in one of its
apartments. Soon after, three or four vile fiends,&mdash;for they do
not deserve the name of men,&mdash;bound him with strong cords and
hanged him to a beam. Then they began to charge him with having
prosecuted a certain Mason, and inflicted upon him the most frightful
tortures. The pen refuses to set forth so many atrocities. For three
days they had him in that position while his vile assassins made a
martyr of him. Our hair stands on end to think of such crimes. The
heart-rending cries of this unfortunate man while prey to such
barbarous torments could be heard in every part of the town and carried
panic to the homes of all the inhabitants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late hours of the night were always chosen by those
treacherous fiends to give Piera the <i>trato de cuerda</i> (this form
of torture consists in tying the hands of the victim behind his back
and hanging him by them by a rope passed through a pulley attached to a
beam; his body is lifted as high as it will go and then allowed to fall
by its own weight without reaching the ground); but this torture was
administered to him in a form so terrible that all the pictures of this
kind of torment found in the dreadful narratives of the calumniators of
the Holy Office, pale into insignificance in comparison with the
atrocious details of the tortures here recited; at each violent jerk
the unhappy victim feeling that his limbs were being torn asunder would
cry out &lsquo;My God! My God!&rsquo; This terrifying cry reverberating
through the jail would freeze the very blood of the poor priests
therein incarcerated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third day, when those infuriated hyenas appeared to
have spent their diabolical rage; after they had thrust a red-hot iron
into his eyes and left him with sightless sockets; the poor martyr, the
prey of delirium, cried out that he was hungry, and one of those
<i>sicarii</i> cut a piece of flesh from Piera&rsquo;s thigh and was
infamous enough to carry it to his mouth. On the night of the seventh
of the month very late a number <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>of wretches buried in the
<i>convento</i> garden a body still dripping warm blood from the lips
of which there escaped the feeble plaints of anguish of a dying
man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feeling of the Spaniards relative to this matter is well shown
by the following statement of Father Malumbres:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This horrible crime cannot be pardoned by God
or man, and is still uninvestigated, crying to Heaven for vengeance
with greater reason than the blood of the innocent Abel. So long as the
criminals remain unpunished it will be a black and indelible stigma and
an ugly stain on the race harbouring in its midst the perpetrators of
this unheard-of sin. Words of reprobation are not enough, justice
demands exemplary and complete reparation, and if the powers of earth
do not take justice into their own hands, God will send fire from
Heaven and will cause to disappear from the face of the earth the
criminals and even their descendants. A murder so cruel and
premeditated can be punished in no other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the courts here should wish to punish the guilty persons
it would not be a difficult task; the public points its finger at those
who dyed their hands in the blood of the heroic soldier, and we shall
set them forth here echoing the voice of the people. The soulless
instigator was Dimas Guzman. The executioners were a certain
Jos&eacute; Guzman (alias Pepin, a nephew of Dimas) and Cayetano
P&eacute;rez.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The matter was duly taken up in the courts, and Judge Blount himself
tried the cases.</p>
<p>The judge takes a very mild and liberal view of the occurrence. He
says of it:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5602src" href="#xd26e5602" name=
"xd26e5602src">14</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Villa was accompanied by his aide, Lieutenant
Ventura Guzman. The latter is an old acquaintance of the author of the
present volume, who tried him afterwards, in 1901, for playing a minor
part in the murder of an officer of the Spanish army committed under
Villa&rsquo;s orders just prior to, or about the time of, the
Wilcox-Sargent visit. He was found guilty, and sentenced, but later
liberated under President Roosevelt&rsquo;s amnesty of 1902. He was
guilty, but the deceased, so the people in the Cagayan Valley used to
say, in being tortured to death, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191"
href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>got only the same sort of
medicine he had often administered thereabouts. At any rate, that was
the broad theory of the amnesty in wiping out all these old
cases.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I sentenced both Dimas and Ventura to life
imprisonment for being accessory to the murder of the Spanish officer
above named, Lieutenant Piera. Villa officiated as arch-fiend on the
grewsome occasion. I am quite sure I would have hung Villa without any
compunction at that time, if I could have gotten hold of him. I tried
to get hold of him, but Governor Taft&rsquo;s attorney-general, Mr.
Wilfley, wrote me that Villa was somewhere over on the mainland of Asia
on British territory, and extradition would involve application to the
London Foreign Office. The intimation was that we had trouble enough of
our own without borrowing any from feuds that had existed under our
predecessors in sovereignty. I have understood that Villa is now
practising medicine in Manila. More than one officer of the American
army that I know afterwards did things to the Filipinos almost as cruel
as Villa did to that unhappy Spanish officer, Lieutenant Piera. On the
whole, I think President Roosevelt acted wisely and humanely in wiping
the slate. We had new problems to deal with, and were not bound to
handicap ourselves with the old ones left over from the Spanish
r&eacute;gime.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5617src" href=
"#xd26e5617" name="xd26e5617src">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it happens that this was the Filipino r&eacute;gime.
Piera&rsquo;s torture occurred at the very time when, according to
Blount, Aguinaldo had &ldquo;a wonderfully complete &lsquo;going
concern&rsquo; throughout the Philippine archipelago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, it occurred in the Cagayan valley where Blount says
&ldquo;perfect tranquillity and public order&rdquo; were then being
maintained by &ldquo;the authority of the Aguinaldo government&rdquo;
in a country which Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent, who arrived on the scene
of this barbarous murder by torture four weeks later, found so
&ldquo;quiet and orderly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure p026width" id="p026"><img src="images/p026.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">A Victim of Yaws before and after Treatment with

<p class="first">The discovery that salvarsan was a specific for the
disfiguring disease known as yaws was made by Dr. R. P. Strong of the
Bureau of Science. The effect of this drug is almost miraculous. A
single injection usually cures completely.</p>
</div>
<p>Not only was Blount perfectly familiar with every detail of this
damnable crime, but he must of necessity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>have known of the
torturing of friars to extort money, which preceded and followed
it.</p>
<p>The following statement seems to sum up his view of the whole
matter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is true there were cruelties practised by
the Filipinos on the Spaniards. But they were ebullitions of revenge
for three centuries of tyranny. They do not prove unfitness for
self-government. I, for one, prefer to follow the example set by the
Roosevelt amnesty of 1902, and draw the veil over all those
matters.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5640src" href="#xd26e5640"
name="xd26e5640src">16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judge drew the veil not only over this, but, as we have seen,
over numerous other pertinent matters which occurred in this land of
&ldquo;profound peace and tranquillity&rdquo; just at the time Wilcox
and Sargent were making their trip. My apologies to him for withdrawing
the veil and for maintaining that such occurrences as those in question
demonstrate complete and utter unfitness for self-government on the
part of those who brought them about!</p>
<p>If it be true that Blount knew more than one officer of the American
army who did things to the Filipinos almost as cruel as Villa did to
Lieutenant Piera, why did he not report them and have the criminals
brought to justice?</p>
<p>Such an attack on the army, in the course of which there is not
given a name or a fact which could serve as a basis for an
investigation, is cowardly and despicable.</p>
<p>I do not for a moment believe that Blount speaks the truth, but if
he does, then his failure to attempt to bring to justice the human
fiends concerned brands him!</p>
<p>It has been the fashion in certain quarters to make vile allegations
of this sort against officers of the United States army, couching them
in discreetly general terms. This is a contemptible procedure, for it
frees those who make reckless charges from danger of the criminal
proceedings which would otherwise doubtless be brought against them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>On arrival at Ilagan, the town where Piera was tortured to death,
Blount says<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5657src" href="#xd26e5657" name=
"xd26e5657src">17</a> that Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent were</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;given a grand <i>baile</i> [ball] and
<i>fiesta</i> [feast], a kind of dinner-dance, we would call
it&#8202;&hellip;. From Ilagan they proceeded to Aparri, cordially
received everywhere, and finding the country in fact, as Aguinaldo
always claimed in his proclamations of that period, seeking recognition
of his government by the Powers, in a state of profound peace and
tranquillity&mdash;free from brigandage and the like.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within sight of the banquet hall, within hearing of the music, lay a
lighter on which were huddled eighty-four priests of the Catholic
Church, many of them gray-haired old men, innocent of any evil conduct,
who for weeks had suffered, mentally and physically, the tortures of
the damned.</p>
<p>Of the events of this evening and the following day Father Malumbres
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;From the river the <i>convento</i> could be
seen profusely illuminated and the strains of music could be heard, an
evident sign that they were engaged in revelry. This gave us a bad
start, as we came to fear that Villa had returned from the expedition
undertaken to come up with two Americans who had crossed the Caraballo
range and were thinking of coming down as far as Aparri. It was late to
announce to Villa our arrival at Ilagan, so that we were obliged to
pass the night on the lighter. In the morning our boat was anchored in
front of the pueblo of Ilagan, where we were credibly informed that
Villa had returned. This accursed news made us begin to fear some
disagreeable incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Matias went ashore and delivered the official
communication regarding our transfer to Villa, while we waited
impatiently for his decision. Sergeant Matias at length returned with
orders for our disembarkation; we put on the best clothes we had and
the rowers placed a broad plank between the lighter and the arsenal and
we left our floating prison two abreast. Matias called the roll and the
order to march, we were eighty-four friars in a long column climbing
the steep ascent to Ilagan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had arrived in front of the building used for
headquarters, we faced about in front thereof, and the first thing we
saw in one of the windows were the sinister features of Falaris, who
with a thundering brow and black look was delighting himself in the
contemplation of so many priests surrounded by bayonets and filled with
misery. Any other person but Villa would have melted on seeing such a
spectacle, which could but incite compassion. The two American tourists
were also looking on at this horrible scene as if stupefied, but they
soon withdrew in order, perhaps, not to look upon such a painful
picture. It was, indeed, heartrending to contemplate therein old
gray-haired men who had passed their lives in apostolic work side by
side with young men who had just arrived in this ungrateful land, and
many sick who rather than men seemed to be marble statues, who had no
recourse but to stand in line, without one word of consolation; therein
figured some who wore religious garb, others in secular dress limited
to a pair of rumpled trousers and a cast-off coat, the lack of this
luxurious garment being replaced in some instances by a native
shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two long hours we were detained in the middle of the
street under the rays of a burning sun and to the scandal of the
immense crowd which had been gathered together to witness the
denouement of the tragedy. The priests had hardly come into the
presence of Villa when Fathers Isidro and Florentino were called out
for the purpose of having heaped upon them a flood of insults and
affronts. Father Isidro was ordered by Villa to interview Sr. Sabas
Orros, who, Villa supposed, would wreak his revenge blindly upon him,
but he was greatly mistaken, as said gentleman treated the priest with
great respect; the tyrant remained talking to Father Florentino in the
reception room of the headquarters building, and when it appeared that
such talk would come to blows, the elder of the Americans left one of
the rooms toward the reception room, and the scene suddenly changing,
Villa arose and addressing the priest said: &lsquo;I am pleased to
introduce to you an American Brigadier-General, Mr. N.&rsquo; The
latter returned a cordial greeting in Spanish to the priest who made a
courteous acknowledgment; after this exchange of courtesies, Villa
resumed his defamatory work, pouring out a string of absurdities and
infamous insults upon the friars, going so far as to say in so many
words: &lsquo;from the bishop down you are all thieves and
depraved&rsquo; he added another word which it would be shameful to
write down, and so he went on from one abyss to another without regard
to reputations or the respect due to venerated persons. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The American let his disgust be seen while Villa was talking,
and the latter understood these protests and ordered the priest to
withdraw, the comedy coming to an end by the American shaking hands
with the priest and offering him assistance. Villa would not shake
hands with him, as was natural, but the priest was able to see that he
was confused when he saw the distinction and courtesy with which an
American general had treated a helpless friar. What a narrow idea did
the Americans form of the government of Aguinaldo, represented by men
as savage and inhuman as Villa!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives averred that the Americans referred to were spies
who had come to explore those provinces and were making maps of the
strategic points and principal roads, so that a very careful watch was
kept upon them and Villa took measures to have them go down the river
without landing at any place between Echague and Ilagan. At Ilagan they
were given an entertainment and dance, Villa being a skilled hand in
this sort of thing, and a few days later he accompanied them to
Aparri<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5692src" href="#xd26e5692" name=
"xd26e5692src">18</a> without allowing them to set foot on land. The
government of Aguinaldo no longer had everything its own way, and
secret orders had been given to have every step of the explorers
followed. The commanding and other leading officers of the Valley,
supporting the orders of the government, circulated an order throughout
the towns which read as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;<span class="sc">To All Local
Officers</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;You will not permit any maps to be made or
notes to be taken of strategic points by Americans or foreigners; nor
will you allow them to become acquainted with the points of defence;
you will endeavour to report immediately to this Government any
suspicious persons; you will make your investigations secretly,
accompanying suspected persons and feigning that their investigations
are approved, and finally when it shall seem to you that such suspected
persons have finished their work, you will advise without loss of time,
in order that their notes may be seized.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite this order the Americans were able to inform
themselves very thoroughly of the forces in the Valley and its state of
defence, and Filipinos were not lacking who for a few pesos would put
them abreast of all information regarding the plans and projects of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Relative to this Wilcox-Sargent trip Taylor says:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In October and November, 1898, Paymaster W. B.
Wilcox, U.S.N., and Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent, U.S.N., travelled
through Northern Luzon from which they returned with a favourable
impression of the government which had been set up by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
agents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was realized by the subtle men whom they met that it was
highly expedient that they should make a favourable report and
accordingly they were well received, and although constant obstacles
were thrown in the way of their seeing what it was not considered well
for them to see yet the real reasons for the delays in their journey
were carefully kept from them. At least some of their letters to the
fleet were taken, translated, and sent to Aguinaldo, who kept them, and
constant reports upon them and their movements were made.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blount refers to the fact that Mr. Sargent tells a characteristic
story of Villa,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5717src" href="#xd26e5717"
name="xd26e5717src">19</a> whose vengeful feeling toward the Spaniards
showed on all occasions.</p>
<p>It would doubtless have interested the travellers to know that the
&ldquo;robbery&rdquo; consisted in taking the funds out of the province
to save them from falling into Villa&rsquo;s hands, and in paying them
to soldiers in Nueva Vizcaya to whom money was due. It would further
have interested them to know that this unfortunate Spaniard had been
twice tortured within an inch of his life by Villa.</p>
<p>But let us continue our interrupted narrative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The presence of the Americans in Ilagan soon
freed us from certain forms of savagery and barbarous intentions on the
part of Villa. There can be no doubt that the tyrant was constantly
cudgelling his brains to invent new methods of showing his contempt for
the friars; at the unlucky time we write of he conceived the infamous
plan of ordering a circular enclosure of cane to be made, put a pig
into it&mdash;we trust the reader will pardon the details&mdash;with a
bell hung to his neck, blindfolded the priests and compelled them to
enter the enclosure with sticks in their hands, and in this ridiculous
attitude, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>obliged them to strike about when the sound of
the bell appraised them of the animal&rsquo;s proximity; it is obvious
that the principal purpose of the fiendish Villa was to have the
priests lay about them in such a way as to deal each other the blows
instead of the pig. The tyrant also had the idea of making us and the
other priests in Ilagan parade the streets of that town dancing and
playing the band. The wish to consummate his plan was not lacking but
he was deterred by the presence of the Americans and the arguments of
Sr. Sabas Orros to whom we also owed the signal favour that Villa did
not take us to our prisons at Tumauini and Gamut on foot and with our
clothing in a bundle at our backs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 2 a banquet was given in Villa&rsquo;s honour at Ilagan
and the pleasant idea occurred to him to have four of the friars dance
at it for his amusement. The people of the town put their handkerchiefs
before their faces to shut out the sight, and some wept. Father Campo,
one of the priests who was obliged to dance, had great ulcers on his
legs from the wounds caused by the cords with which he had been bound
when he was tortured with water, and was at first unable to raise his
feet from the floor; but Villa threatened him with a rattan until he
finally did so. This caused the sores on his legs to burst open so that
the bones showed.</p>
<p>On the 3d of October a number of the friars were compelled to get up
a band and go out and meet Leyba with music on his arrival. The people
of the towns closed their windows in disgust at the sight. A great
crowd had gathered to receive Leyba, and the priests were compelled to
dance in the middle of the street, but this again only caused disgust.
A couple of priests were then beaten in the usual fashion in a private
house. This caused murmuring even among those of the soldiers who were
natives of the Cagayan valley. At the same time two other priests were
horribly whipped in the prison.</p>
<p>This has been a long story, but the half has not been told. Those
who escaped torture had their feelings <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>harrowed by the sight
of the sufferings of their fellows. They were constantly and grossly
insulted; were often confined in the most unsanitary quarters; given
poor and insufficient food and bad water, or none at all; robbed of
their clothing; compelled to march long distances under a tropical sun
when sick, wounded and suffering; obliged to do servants&rsquo; work
publicly; forced to make a ridiculous spectacle of themselves in the
public streets; ordered to recant, and heaven knows what not!</p>
<p>The torments practised on them had two principal objects: to compel
them to give up money, and to discredit them with the common people.
They failed to accomplish this latter result. There is abundant
evidence that the natives of the Cagayan valley clothed and fed them
when they could, and wept over the painful humiliations and the
dreadful sufferings which they were powerless to prevent or
relieve.</p>
<p>The tormentors were men from distant provinces, with no possible
personal grievances against the priests whom they martyrized. Their
action was the result, not of an &ldquo;ebullition of revenge for three
centuries of tyranny&rdquo; as stated by Blount, but of insensate greed
of gold and damnable viciousness. I believe the American people will
hold that such cruelities brand those who practise them as unfit to
govern their fellows, or themselves.</p>
<p>Lest I be accused of basing my conclusions on <i>ex parte</i>
statements I will now return to the Insurgent record of events in the
Cagayan valley.</p>
<p>At the outset the Spanish officers of the Tabacalera
Company<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5750src" href="#xd26e5750" name=
"xd26e5750src">20</a> fared comparatively well. In a letter dated
September 27, 1898, and addressed to the secretary of war of the
revolutionary government, Leyba says of the taking of Tuguegarao that
the only terms of the surrender were to respect life. He therefore felt
at liberty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>to seize all the money that the friars had
hidden, &ldquo;which was accomplished by applying the stick.&rdquo; He
adds that they did nothing to the agents of the great Tabacalera
Company, then the most powerful commercial organization in the Islands,
for the significant reason that they had found that its stock was
largely held by Frenchmen and feared trouble.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5757src" href="#xd26e5757" name="xd26e5757src">21</a></p>
<p>On December 4, 1898, Leyba, concerning whose ideas as to public
order we are already informed, wrote a most illuminating letter setting
forth the conditions which had existed there. He does not claim that
there had been Octavian peace!</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that this letter covers the very time
during which Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent passed through the Cagayan
valley. It paints a vivid picture of conditions, and as the painter was
the ranking Insurgent officer in the valley during this entire period,
he cannot be accused of hostile prejudice. I therefore give the letter
in full&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Aparri</span>, December 4,
1898.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Don Baldomero Aguinaldo</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">The Secretary of War</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Sir and of My Greatest Esteem</span>: I
take the liberty of addressing this to you in order to state that owing
to the lack of discipline in the soldiers whom we have brought, since
they are all volunteers and whom I am not able to reduce <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>to
rigorous subordination, for the revolution would find itself without
soldiers with whom to win triumph, they committed many abuses and
misdeed which, for the lack of evidence, I was not able to punish,
although I knew of these abuses but had no proof, and as a lover of my
country and of the prestige of the Revolutionary Army, I took care not
to disclose the secret to any one, in this way avoiding the formation
of an atmosphere against the cause of our Independence to the grave
injury of us all. But it happened that, in spite of the good advice
which I have given them and the punishments which I have given to some
of the 3d Company of Cauit, they did not improve their conduct but have
gone to the extreme of committing a scandalous robbery of 20,800 pesos
which sum the German, Otto Weber, was taking to the capital, which deed
has caused me to work without ceasing, without sleeping entire nights,
for I understood what a serious matter it was to take money from a
foreigner. After making many inquiries, it was discovered that a very
large part of the money which reached the sum of $10,000, a little more
or less, was buried under the quarters which the said company occupied,
this with the sanction of all the officers, it appears to me, because
it is impossible that such a sum could be brought into a house where so
many soldiers are living without the knowledge of the officers.</p>
<div class="figure p027width" id="p027"><img src="images/p027.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">The Culion Leper Colony</p>
<p class="first">Here all known Philippine lepers have been isolated
and humanely cared for. As a result, leprosy is rapidly disappearing
from the Islands.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indignant at such shameful behaviour, I reprimanded the
officers and preferred charges against the ones I deemed to blame in
the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards I found out that they had attempted to murder me
for trying to find out the originators of the crime. On account of
this, and in order to prevent a civil war which would have broken out
against the said soldiers if precautions had not been taken, I decided
to disarm them, to the great displeasure of the Colonel who was not
aware of my motives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bad conduct has been copied by the soldiers of the 4th
Company stationed in Ilagan, and I believe the Colonel, guided by my
warning, will take the same measures in regard to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the officers are the first ones to commit abuses and
misdeeds, it is easily seen that the soldiers under their orders,
guided by them, will commit worse ones than the chiefs, and as these
seem to lack the moral strength to control and reprimand them, I
propose to you, if it meets your approval, that all these soldiers and
some of the officers be returned to their homes by the steamer
<i>Luzon</i>, if there should be sufficient coal, or in another if you
order it, since they tell me themselves that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>because they are far away from their homes they
do not wish to continue in the service in this province. This is easily
arranged as there are now men stationed in this province for
instructing the native volunteers, many of whom have been students, and
will therefore make good officers and non-commissioned officers, and in
this way a battalion could be formed, well disciplined from the
beginning and disgraceful things would be avoided not only towards the
natives of this province but also towards foreigners, which is the most
important. Having stated my case, I place myself always at your
disposal, requesting you will attend to this affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With reference to the 4th Company stationed in the Province
of Isabela, whose captain is Don Antonio Monzon of Panamitan, there are
many complaints of thefts and assaults committed by the soldiers, and
in answer to my questions, Don Sime&oacute;n Adriano y Villa, Major and
Sanitary Inspector and doctor of this battalion, whom I have stationed
there for lack of a competent person, tells me that he has always
punished and offered advice to officers and soldiers in order to
prevent the recurrence of thefts and assaults, but he has never been
able to suppress them completely, because the soldiers are abandoned by
their officers, and because of lack of example on the part of the
latter; they do not understand that it is a great blot when they commit
these abuses, since when they discover the goods or house of a Spaniard
they believe they have a right to appropriate everything which they
encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned lately, that some foreigners, residents in
that province, among them some employees of the Tobacco Factory,
&lsquo;El Oriente&rsquo; and of the firm of Baer Senior &amp; Co., who
have Spanish employees in various pueblos of that province, have some
very serious complaints to make of assaults committed against them
prejudicial to their interests; however, I hope that now with the
arrival of General Tirona he will regulate matters, although I believe
that this gentleman is not sufficiently energetic in proceeding against
the officers and soldiers, as I have seen when I reprimanded and
punished them for faults committed he has pardoned them, and it appears
that he censures energetic acts which we must use in order to subject
them to rigorous discipline. The same thing happened when Major Sr.
Victa wished to discipline them; it appears that the Colonel
reprimanded him when he punished some soldiers for gambling in their
quarters, since, as you know, that gentleman believes that he who is
right is the one who comes to him first, and who is best able to
flatter him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Colonel has agreed with me that his first act on arrival
at the province of Isabela should be to disarm and take all the money
he finds among the soldiers of the 4th Company (Panamitan) in order to
serve as indemnity for the property of the foreigners in case they
should make any claim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I request that you send some leader or officer in order to
superintend our actions, and to lift the doubt which hangs over the
person who has worked faithfully and honourably in the sacred cause of
our Independence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am filling the position of First Chief in the Port of
Aparri temporarily on account of the absence of the Colonel who has
conferred on me all his duties and power. After the military operations
which were carried on as far as the last town in Isabela, being tired
and somewhat sick, I was put in charge of these military headquarters,
which I found to be very much mixed up, the town, moreover, being
desperate on account of the assaults committed by my predecessor,
Rafael Perca, who was appointed by the Colonel, and who was formerly 2d
Captain of the steamer <i>Filipinas.</i> After arriving and taking
charge, having received numerous complaints against him, I had him
arrested and I found that he had been guilty of robbery, unlawful use
of insignia, illegal marriage, rape and attempted rape. I hold him in
custody only awaiting the arrival of the Colonel in order to convene a
court-martial for his trial, in which the Colonel will act as President
and I as Judge Advocate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With nothing more to communicate, I hope you will attend to
my just claim and send a special delegate to investigate our acts and
see the truth, for perhaps if a statement comes direct from me you will
not believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your affectionate and faithful subordinate, who kisses
your hand,</p>
<p>(Signed) &ldquo;<span class="sc">J. N. Leyba</span>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5834src" href="#xd26e5834" name=
"xd26e5834src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blount states that conditions existed &ldquo;just like this, all
over Luzon and the Visayan Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5839src" href="#xd26e5839" name="xd26e5839src">23</a>
Unfortunately this was only too true!</p>
<p>The troops complained of by Leyba were made up of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
fellow townsmen. They never obeyed any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>one else, and left a
trail of murder and rapine behind them. Aguinaldo never punished them,
and from the time when one of them tried to murder their commander
until a guard composed of them murdered General Antonio Luna in June,
1899, they are mentioned only with fear and execration.</p>
<p>Blount describes with enthusiasm the establishment of civil
government in Cagayan.</p>
<p>Perhaps Americans will be interested in knowing who was its head and
how it worked. The &ldquo;elections&rdquo; were held on December 9,
1898, and Dimas Guzman was chosen head of the province. He was the man
subsequently sentenced to life-imprisonment by Blount, for complicity
in the murder of Lieutenant Piera. In describing his method of
conducting his government he says that the people doubted the legality
of attempts to collect taxes; that the abuses of heads of towns caused
rioting in the towns, in which only Ilocanos took part; and that he not
only did not report these things but contrived to conceal them from
foreigners in the province.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5850src" href=
"#xd26e5850" name="xd26e5850src">24</a></p>
<p>His failure to report these troubles and disorders to his government
is of interest, as Blount alleges<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5855src"
href="#xd26e5855" name="xd26e5855src">25</a> that differences
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>between the local authorities were in a number
of cases referred to the Malolos government for settlement.</p>
<p>Blount says<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5864src" href="#xd26e5864"
name="xd26e5864src">26</a> that General Otis&rsquo;s reports were full
of inexcusable blunders about the Tag&aacute;logs taking possession of
provinces and making the people do things, and cites the relations
between Villa and Dimas Guzman to illustrate the error of these
allegations.</p>
<p>He has elsewhere<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5870src" href=
"#xd26e5870" name="xd26e5870src">27</a> referred to Villa as the
&ldquo;arch-fiend&rdquo; in the matter of torturing the unhappy
Spaniards as well as the Filipinos who incurred his ill-will. We have
seen that Guzman proved an apt pupil and did credit to his instructor
in connection with the torturing of Lieutenant Piera, but it
nevertheless appears from Guzman&rsquo;s own statements that his
relations with the Insurgent officers and their subordinates involved
some rather grave difficulties. Of Major Canoy, for instance, he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I must add that the said Major Canoy is such a
remarkable character that he saw fit to give my cook a beating for not
taking off his hat when he met him. He insulted the delegate of rents
of Cabagan Viejo for the same reason. He struck the head man of the
town of Bagabag in the face. He put some of the members of the town
council of Echague in the stocks, and he had others
whipped.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5876src" href="#xd26e5876"
name="xd26e5876src">28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was really incautious for Governor Guzman to complain of these
conditions because Major Canoy and his party won, and the Governor had
to resign.</p>
<p>But the day of reckoning came. It was in consequence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>of
the atrocities committed by the Tag&aacute;log soldiers in the Cagayan
valley that Captain Batchelder was able a little later to march
practically unopposed through the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela
and Cagayan with one battalion of American negro troops, for whom he
had neither food nor extra ammunition, and that Tirona surrendered the
Insurgent forces in the valley without attempting resistance!

&ldquo;On account of this the vulgar people doubted the legality of our
actions in the collection of taxes, and accordingly it became
difficult; and this, coupled with the inveterate abuses of the heads of
the towns, which the head of the province was not able to perceive in
time to check, caused a tumult in Echague, which, owing to wise
councils and efforts at pacification, was appeased without it being
followed by serious consequences; but I have no doubt that this tumult
was due only to the suggestions of ungovernable and passionate persons
animated by the spirit of faction, since those who took part in it were
all Ilocanos, no native of Echague having any hand in it. The same
thing occurred in Naguilian, where the disorders were also quieted. Not
only did I make no report of all this to the government of the republic

<p class="first">Referring to the conditions alleged to have been found
by Sargent and Wilcox in the Cagayan valley, Blount says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Had another Sargent and another Wilcox made a
similar trip through the provinces of southern Luz&oacute;n about this
same time, under similar friendly auspices, before we turned friendship
to hate and fear and misery, in the name of Benevolent Assimilation,

</blockquote>
<p>So far as concerns the provinces of Mindoro and Palawan, and the
great island of Mindanao, he dodges the issue, alleging the
unimportance of Mindoro and Palawan, and claiming that
&ldquo;Mohammedan Mindanao&rdquo; presents a problem by itself. Under
such generalities he hides the truth as to what happened in these
regions.</p>
<p>I agree with him that there was essential identity between actual
conditions in the Cagayan valley and those which prevailed under
Insurgent rule elsewhere in Luz&oacute;n and in the Visayas. I will go
further and say that conditions in the Cagayan valley did not differ
essentially from those which prevailed throughout all portions of the
archipelago which fell under Insurgent control, except that in several
provinces captured friars and other Spaniards were quickly murdered
whereas in the Cagayan valley no friar was quite killed outright by
torture. Those who ultimately died of their injuries lived for some
time.</p>
<p>Let us now consider some of the actual occurrences in <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first province visited by Messrs. Wilcox and
Sargent after leaving Aparri was South Ilocos. The conditions which had
prevailed at Vigan, the capital of the province, shortly before their
arrival, are described in a letter signed &ldquo;Mariano&rdquo; and
addressed under date of September 25, 1898, to Se&ntilde;or Don Mena
Cris&oacute;logo, from which I quote extracts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Mena</span>: I read with
a happy heart your letter of the 3rd instant, and in answer I have to
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 22nd of August a mass meeting was held for the
election of the local presidente of this town, and I was elected to the
office; and on the 1st instant the Colonel appointed me Provisional
Provincial President of this province, so that you can imagine the
position I am in and the responsibilities which weigh on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your house is occupied by the Colonel, in view of the fact
that it is not rented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have here eleven friar prisoners and the damned priests who
escaped from here have not as yet been returned, but it is known that
they are prisoners in Cagayan, and as soon as they arrive here I will
treat them as they deserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great regret that I have to relate the events and
misfortunes which we have been suffering here since the arrival of the
troops, as all the detachments are supported by the towns, and here in
the capital where the commissary is established, our resources are
exhausted, owing to the unreasonable demands of the commissary, because
he never asks what is only just and necessary, but if he needs
provisions for 200 men, he always asks enough for 1000. And
notwithstanding this, the most lamentable and sad occurrences are
taking place almost daily in the different barrios, and often in the
town itself; the soldiers are guilty of many abuses and disorderly
acts, such as rapes and murders, which usually remain unpunished by
reason of the real authors thereof not being found, and when they are
found and reported to their commanders, the latter do nothing. One
night the house and estate of Sario Tinon in Anannam was sacked by six
armed men, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>threatened him and took his money, his
wife&rsquo;s jewels and the best horses he had. Thank God that his
family was at the time in the capital, and it appears that now the
authors of this act are being discovered.</p>

to deceive and prejudice the honest inhabitants of the Philippines; for
which reason we now suffer what we are suffering, as you see, according
to the old adage that &ldquo;he who owes must pay.&rdquo; And now we
inform all you honest Filipinos that we repent for the acts above
referred to, which are in contravention of the laws and good customs,
and ask your pardon.&mdash;<span class="sc">Vigan</span>, September 13,
1898.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which I communicate to you in order that you may form

<p>The province of Abra, now a subprovince of South Ilocos, was
evidently no exception to the general rule, for there is on file a
letter to Aguinaldo with twenty-six signatures, protesting bitterly
against the oppression of the poor, in the effort to compel them to
contribute war taxes, complaining against the misuse of supplies
gathered ostensibly for the soldiers, and stating that the petitioners
will be obliged to take refuge with the Igorots and Negritos, if not
granted relief.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5954src" href="#xd26e5954"

<p>Apparently the trouble grew, for on December 27, 1898, the
&ldquo;Director of Diplomacy&rdquo; telegraphed to Aguinaldo concerning
it, saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most urgent. The discontent in the provinces of
Pangasin&aacute;n, Tarlac and Yloco (Ilocos) is increasing. The town of
Bangbang rose in revolt the 25th and 26th of this month, and killed all

committed by the military and civil authorities of the said provinces.

Manila City, left much to be desired.</p>
<p>Admiral Dewey made a statement applicable to the territory adjacent
to the city and bay of Manila in a cablegram to Washington dated
October 14, 1898, which reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is important that the disposition of the
Philippine Islands should be decided as soon as
possible&#8202;&hellip;. General anarchy prevails without the limits of
the city and bay of Manila. Natives appear unable to
govern.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6027src" href="#xd26e6027"

<p>Of it Blount says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In this cablegram the Admiral most
unfortunately repeated as true some wild rumours then currently
accepted by the Europeans and Americans at Manila which, of course,
were impossible of verification. I say &lsquo;unfortunately&rsquo; with
some earnestness, because it does not appear on the face of his message
that they were mere rumours. And, that they were wholly erroneous, in
point of fact, has already been cleared up in previous chapters,
wherein the real state of peace, order, and tranquillity which
prevailed throughout Luz&oacute;n at that time has been, it is
believed, put beyond all doubt.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

</blockquote>
<p>Blount seems here to have overlooked the fact that the admiral
himself was in Manila Bay and in Manila City at the time he sent this
cablegram. The statements in question were not rumours, they were
deliberate expressions of opinion on the part of a man who had
first-hand information and knew what he was saying.</p>
<p>They were not the Admiral&rsquo;s only allegations on this subject.
When testifying before the Senate committee he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>Admiral Dewey</i>. I knew that there was no

and brigadier general respectively, who are charged with abandonment of
their posts in the field, disobedience and attempts against the union
of the Insurgents, had been committing all manner of abuses. They had

the town of Sorsog&oacute;n, who are prosperous people, to contribute
to the support of his troops. They at once gave him cloth for uniforms,

<h3 class="main">Mindoro</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Conditions in the important island of Mindoro may be
inferred from the fact that it became necessary for its governor to
issue a decree on November 10, 1898, which contained the following
provisions among others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;2nd. The local presidentes of the pueblos will
not permit any one belonging to their jurisdiction to pass from one
pueblo to another nor to another province without the corresponding
pass, with a certificate upon its back that the taxes of its holder
have been paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3rd. That from this date no one will be allowed to absent
himself from his pueblo without previously informing its head who will
give him an authorization on which will be noted the approval of the
presidente of the pueblo&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5th. Persons arriving from a neighboring town or province in
any pueblo of this province will immediately present themselves before
the presidente of said pueblo with their passes. He will without
charge, stamp them with his official seal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6204src" href="#xd26e6204" name="xd26e6204src">21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are peculiar regulations for a province which is at peace, and
as Major Taylor has truly remarked:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The form of liberty contemplated by the
founders of the Philippine Republic was not considered incompatible
with a very considerable absence of personal freedom.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6212src" href="#xd26e6212" name=
"xd26e6212src">22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, when travelling through Mindoro, I was told how an
unfortunate legless Spaniard, who had been running a small shop in one
of the towns and who was on good terms with his Filipino neighbors, was
carried out into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>the plaza, seated in a chair, and then cut
to pieces with bolos in the presence of his wife and children who were
compelled to witness the horrible spectacle!</p>
<p>On this same trip Captain R. G. Offley, then the American Governor
of Mindoro, told me while I was at Pinamalayan that the people there
were greatly alarmed because a murderer, liberated under the amnesty,
had returned and was prowling about in that vicinity. This man had a
rather unique record. He had captured one of his enemies, and after
stripping him completely had caused the top of an immense ant-hill to
be dug off. The unfortunate victim was then tied, laid on it, and the
earth and ants which had been removed were shovelled back over his body
until only his head projected. The ants did the rest! Another rather
unusual achievement of this interesting individual was to tie the feet
of one of his enemies to a tree, fasten a rope around his neck, hitch a
carabao to the rope, and start up the carabao, thus pulling off the
head of his victim. Yet this man and others like him were set at
liberty under the amnesty proclamation, in spite of the vigorous
protests of the Philippine Commission, who thought that murderers of
this type ought to be hanged.</p>
<p>And now I wish to discuss briefly an interesting and highly
characteristic statement of Judge Blount. In referring to conditions in
the Visayan Islands, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Of course the Southern Islands were a little
slower. But as Luz&oacute;n goes, so go the rest. The rest of the
archipelago is but the tail to the Luz&oacute;n kite. Luz&oacute;n
contains 4,000,000 of the 8,000,000 people out there, and Manila is to
the Filipino people what Paris is to the French and to France.
Luz&oacute;n is about the size of Ohio, and the other six islands that
really matter, are in size mere little Connecticuts and Rhode Islands,
and in population mere Arizonas or New Mexicos.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6226src" href="#xd26e6226" name=
"xd26e6226src">23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph is no exception to the general rule that the
statements of this author will not bear analysis. One <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>of
the other six islands that he says really matters is Samar. Its area is
5031 square miles. The area of Rhode Island is 1250 square miles. The
smallest of the six islands named is Bohol, with an area of 1411 square
miles. It cannot be called a little Rhode Island.</p>
<p>As regards population, Arizona has 122,931. It is hardly proper to
call either Panay with a population of 743,646, Cebu with 592,247,
Negros with 460,776, Leyte with 357,641, Bohol with 243,148 or even
Samar with only 222,690, a mere Arizona, and New Mexico with 195,310 is
also a bit behind.</p>
<p>Luz&oacute;n really has an area of 40,969 square miles and a
population of 3,798,507.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6237src" href=

<p>Even so, the tail is a trifle long and heavy for the kite, but if we
are going to compare Luz&oacute;n with &ldquo;the Southern
Islands,&rdquo; by which Blount can presumably only mean the rest of
the archipelago, why not really do it? The process involves nothing
more complicated than the subtraction of its area and population from
those of the archipelago as a whole.</p>

<p>Performing this operation, we discover that the tail would fly away
with the kite, as Luz&oacute;n has less than half of the total
population and only a little more than a third of the total area.</p>
<p>To compare the area or the population of one large island with those
of individual small ones, in determining the relative importance of the
former in the country of which it makes up a part, is like comparing
the area and population of a great state with those of the individual
counties going to make up other states.</p>
<p>Blount resorts to a similar questionable procedure in trying to show
the insignificance of Mindoro and Palawan. There are an island of
Mindoro and a province of Mindoro; an island of Palawan and a province
of Palawan. In each case the province, which includes numerous small
islands, as well as the large one from which it takes its name, is much
larger and more populous than is the main island, and obviously it is
the province with which we are concerned.</p>
<p>Even if Blount wished to limit discussion to the Christian natives
commonly called Filipinos, his procedure is still wholly unfair. Of
these there are 3,575,001 in Luz&oacute;n and 3,412,685 in the other
islands. In other words, the Filipino population is almost equally
divided between the two regions.</p>
<p>As he would not have found it convenient to discuss the conditions
which arose in Mindanao under Insurgent rule, he attempts to show that
no political importance attaches to them. In the passage above quoted
he does not so much as mention either Mindoro or Palawan (Paragua).
Elsewhere, however, he attempts to justify his action by making the
following statements:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The political or governmental problem being now
reduced from 3141 islands to eleven, the last three<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6353src" href="#xd26e6353" name="xd26e6353src">25</a> of the
nine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>contained in the above table may also be
eliminated as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6358src" href=
"#xd26e6358" name="xd26e6358src">26</a>&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mindoro, the large island just south of the main bulk of
Luz&oacute;n, pierced by the 121st meridian of longitude east of
Greenwich, is thick with densely wooded mountains and jungle over a
large part of its area, has a reputation of being very unhealthy
(malarious), is also very sparsely settled, and does not now, nor has
it ever, cut any figure politically as a disturbing
factor.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6363src" href="#xd26e6363"
name="xd26e6363src">27</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the fact that the political problem involved in the
government of the important islands which Blount would thus leave out
of consideration, is not solved by ignoring it, certain of his further
statements cannot be allowed to go uncorrected.</p>
<p>The allegation that the island has never &ldquo;cut any figure
politically as a disturbing factor&rdquo; is absurd. In the Spanish
days its forests furnished a safe refuge for evildoers who were from
time to time driven out of Cavite and Batangas. A large proportion of
its Filipino inhabitants were criminals who not infrequently organized
regular piratical expeditions and raided towns in Masbate, Romblon and
Palawan. The people of the Cuyos and Calamianes groups lived in
constant terror of the Mindoro pirates, and <i>tulisanes</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6375src" href="#xd26e6375" name=
"xd26e6375src">28</a> who paid them frequent visits. I myself have been
at Calapan, the capital of the province, when the Spanish officials did
not dare to go without armed escort as far as the outskirts of the town
for fear of being captured and held for ransom. During considerable
periods they did not really pretend to exercise control over the
criminal Filipinos inhabiting the west coast of the island. Conditions
as to public order were worse in Mindoro than anywhere else in the
archipelago north of Mindanao and Jol&oacute;.</p>
<p>No less absurd are Blount&rsquo;s suggestions as to the general
worthlessness of the island. There are high mountains in its interior,
and there are great stretches of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>most fertile land in
the world along its coast. Its northern and eastern portions have a
very heavy and evenly distributed rainfall, and are admirably suited to
the growing of cocoanuts, hemp, cacao, rubber and similar tropical
products. In this region rice flourishes wonderfully without
irrigation. There was a time in the past when Mindoro was known as
&ldquo;the granary of the Philippines.&rdquo; Later its population was
decimated by constant Moro attacks, and cattle disease destroyed its
draft animals, with the result that the cultivated lands were abandoned
to a considerable extent and again grew up to jungle, from which,
however, it is easy to redeem them. The west coast has strongly marked
wet and dry seasons similar to those at Manila. There is abundant water
available for irrigation, furnished by streams which never run dry.
Much of the soil is rich, and will grow the best of sugar in large
quantity. The forests, which now cover extensive areas, abound in fine
woods, and produce rubber and other valuable gums. There are
outcroppings of lignite at numerous points on the island, and in the
vicinity of Mt. Halcon is found the finest marble yet discovered in
this part of the world. Gold is also present in some quantity at
various places. In short, Mindoro is naturally one of the richest
islands in the Archipelago. If its tillable lands were under high
cultivation, it would support half the population of the
Philippines.</p>

<h3 class="main">Palawan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In endeavouring to show that Palawan is without
political importance Blount has followed precisely the procedure which
he adopted in the case of Mindoro. First, he gives the area and the
population of the island, when he should concern himself with the
province. The area of the island is 4027 square miles; that of the
province, 5238 square miles. According to the 1903 census, the
population of the island was 10,918, while that of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>province, which contains such thickly settled
and fertile islands as Cuyo and Agutaya, was 39,582. Of course, if one
wishes to emphasize the unimportance of Palawan, it is more convenient
to take the figures for the island.</p>
<p>Blount says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Paragua,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6394src"
href="#xd26e6394" name="xd26e6394src">29</a> the long narrow island
seen at the extreme lower left of any map of the archipelago, extending
northeast-southwest at an angle of about 45&deg;, is practically
worthless, being fit for nothing much except a penal colony, for which
purpose it is in fact now used.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6397src" href="#xd26e6397" name="xd26e6397src">30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must deny the truthfulness of his statements, even if we limit our
consideration to the island of Palawan. Only 159 of its 4027 square
miles are utilized for a penal colony. Its natural wealth is simply
enormous. It is covered throughout the greater part of its extent with
virgin forest containing magnificent stands of the best timber. Damar,
a very valuable varnish gum, is abundant in its mountains. Much of the
so-called &ldquo;Singapore cane,&rdquo; so highly prized by makers of
rattan and wicker furniture, comes from its west coast. It is a
well-watered island, and its level plains, which receive the wash from
its heavily forested mountains, have a soil of unsurpassed fertility in
which cocoanuts come to bearing in five years or even less.
Incidentally, the greater part of the island lies south of the typhoon
belt. Malampaya Sound, situated near its northwestern extremity, is one
of the world&rsquo;s great harbors. But should we wish to rid ourselves
of this wonderful island, I may say, without violating any official
confidences, that there was a time when Germany would have been more
than pleased to take it off our hands; and indeed our British friends,
who were sufficiently interested in it to survey it some decades ago,
might possibly be prevailed upon to accept it!</p>
<p>There are good reasons why Blount thought it convenient to make it
appear that Palawan was politically unimportant. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities with
Spain the Filipino garrison at Puerto Princesa mutinied, and the things
which they did were not nice. Among others, they liberated the
convicts, Puerto Princesa being at the time a penal colony, and the
latter, together with some of the soldiers, started up the east coast
of the island, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. The
prosperous town of Tinitian was abandoned as they approached it, and
was so thoroughly cleaned out by them that it has never since been
reoccupied except by a few stragglers. Other towns, including Tay-Tay,
were raided.</p>
<p>On November 27, 1899, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s representative in this
province wrote him that the inhabitants were preparing to kill all the
Tag&aacute;logs and revolt against Insurgent rule.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6408src" href="#xd26e6408" name="xd26e6408src">31</a> Later
when some of the latter were anxious to get the people of one of the
northern settlements to take them on a short boat journey, these
Visayans consented to give them a lift only on condition that they
first allow themselves to be bound, and then took them out to sea and
threw them overboard.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Famous Zig-zag on the Benguet Road</p>
</div>
<p>Another thing which Blount would have found it inconvenient to
discuss is the conduct of the people of Cuyo, at one time the capital
of the province. On this island, which contains but twenty-one square
miles, there were in 1903 no less than 7545 inhabitants. They hated and
feared the people of Mindoro and sent messengers to Iloilo, after the
Americans had occupied that place, to beg for a garrison of American
troops, and to say that if furnished with an American flag they
themselves would defend it. For some reason they were not given the
flag, and the sending of a garrison was long delayed. Having grown
weary of waiting, they made an American flag of their own, hoisted it,
and when the Insurgents from Mindoro came intrenched themselves and
defended it. They were actually being besieged when the American
garrison finally arrived. Here is one more fact inconsistent with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>the theory that the Filipino people were a unit
at Aguinaldo&rsquo;s back, and of course the easiest way to get around
such an occurrence is to forget to mention it!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">And now we come to the great island of Mindanao, which
all but equals Luz&oacute;n in size, having an area of 36,292 square
miles as against the 40,969 of Luz&oacute;n. Blount&rsquo;s first
mention of it is peculiar.</p>
<p>In connection with the words &ldquo;the other six islands that
really matter,&rdquo; in the passage above cited on page 116 of his
book, he has inserted a foot-note reading as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The six main Visayan Islands. Mohammedan
Mindanao is always dealt with in this book as a separate and distinct
problem.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6430src" href="#xd26e6430"
name="xd26e6430src">32</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it was hardly possible for him to dismiss this great island,
which is a little continent by itself, quite so cavalierly and I will
quote the more important of his further and later statements regarding
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;While the great Mohammedan island of Mindanao,
near Borneo, with its 36,000 square miles of area, requires that the
Philippine archipelago be described as stretching over more than one
thousand miles from north to south, still, inasmuch as Mindanao only
contains about 500,000 people all told, half of them semi-civilized,
the governmental problem it presents has no more to do with the main
problem of whether, if ever, we are to grant independence to the
7,000,000 Christians of the other islands, than the questions that have
to be passed on by our Commissioner of Indian Affairs have to do with
the tariff. Mindanao&rsquo;s 36,000 square miles constitute nearly a
third of the total area of the Philippine archipelago, and more than
that fraction of the 97,500 square miles of territory to a
consideration of which our attention is reduced by the process of
elimination above indicated. Turning over Mindanao to those crudely
Mohammedan semi-civilized Moros would indeed be &lsquo;like granting
self-government to an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>Apache reservation under some
local chief,&rsquo; as Mr. Roosevelt, in the campaign of 1900,
ignorantly declared it would be to grant self-government to
Luz&oacute;n under Aguinaldo. Furthermore, the Moros, so far as they
can think, would prefer to owe allegiance to, and be entitled to
recognition as subjects of, some great nation. Again, because the
Filipinos have no moral right to control the Moros, and could not if
they would, the latter being fierce fighters and bitterly opposed to
the thought of possible ultimate domination by the Filipinos, the most
uncompromising advocate of the consent of the governed principles has
not a leg to stand on with regard to Mohammedan Mindanao. Hence I
affirm that as to it, we have a distinct separate problem, which cannot
be solved in the lifetime of anybody now living. But it is a problem
which need not in the least delay the advent of independence for the
other fourteen fifteenths of the inhabitants of the
archipelago&mdash;all Christians living on islands north of Mindanao.
It is true that there are some Christian Filipinos on Mindanao, but in
policing the Moros, our government would of course protect them from
the Moros. If they did not like our government, they could move to such
parts of the islands as we might permit to be incorporated in an
ultimate Philippine republic. Inasmuch as the 300,000 or so Moros of
the Mohammedan island of Mindanao and the adjacent islets called Jolo
(the &lsquo;Sulu archipelago,&rsquo; so called, &lsquo;reigned
over&rsquo; by the sultan of comic opera fame) originally presented, as
they will always present, a distinct and separate problem, and never
did have anything more to do with the Philippine insurrection against
us than their cousins and co-religionists over in near-by Borneo, the
task which confronted Mr. Root in the fall of 1899, to wit, the
suppression of the Philippine insurrection, meant practically the
subjugation of one big island, Luz&oacute;n, containing half the
population and one third of the total area of the archipelago, and six
neighbouring small ones, the Visayan Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6440src" href="#xd26e6440" name="xd26e6440src">33</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now as a matter of fact Mindanao is by no means Mohammedan. The
Mohammedan Malays, called Moros, are found here and there along the
western coast of the Zamboanga peninsula and along the southern coast
of the island as far as Davao. They also extend far up the Cotabato
River and occupy the Lake Lanao region, but that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>is
all. The interior of the island is for the most part occupied by the
members of a number of non-Christian, non-Mohammedan tribes, while its
northern and eastern coasts are inhabited by Visayan Filipinos, of whom
there are many in Zamboanga itself.</p>
<p>While, as Blount says, the Moros took no part in the insurrection
against the United States, the Visayans of Mindanao did, and we had
some lively tussles with them in Misamis and in Surigao.</p>
<p>It is indeed unthinkable that we should turn Mindanao over to the
Moros. Abandonment of it by us would in the end result in this, as they
would take possession of the entire island in the course of time.
Neither the other wild tribes nor the Filipinos could stand against
them. I heartily agree with the conclusion that we must retain this
island for many years before we can settle the problems which it
presents. It is further true that we might retain it and still grant
independence to the remainder of the Philippine Archipelago, but if we
are to eliminate Mindanao from consideration because the Filipinos have
no right to control the Moros, of whom there are in reality only about
a hundred and fifty-four thousand<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6451src"
href="#xd26e6451" name="xd26e6451src">34</a> on the island, and could
not if they would, what about Luz&oacute;n, where there are in reality
no less than four hundred and sixty thousand non-Christians,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6454src" href="#xd26e6454" name=
"xd26e6454src">35</a> many of whom, like the Ifugaos, Bontoc Igorots,
Kalingas and wild Tingians, are fierce fighters and practically all of
whom are bitterly opposed to the thought of possible ultimate
domination by Filipinos, while most of them welcome American rule?</p>
<p>Have the Filipinos any more moral right to control them than they
have to control the Moros? Could they control them if they would? And
has the most uncompromising advocate of the consent of the governed
principle &ldquo;a leg to stand on&rdquo; in the one case if he lacks
it in the other?</p>
<p>The Filipino politicians are not ready to admit that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>Filipinos could not satisfactorily govern Moros
and have even alleged that they did so govern them during the period
now under discussion. Let us examine the facts.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo attempted to enter into negotiations with the Sultan of
Jol&oacute;, addressing him as his &ldquo;great and powerful
brother,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6468src" href="#xd26e6468"
name="xd26e6468src">36</a> but this brother does not seem to have
received his advances with enthusiasm, and the other brothers proceeded
to do things to the Filipinos at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; Roa in writing Aguinaldo on January 26, 1899, of
conditions in the province of Misamis says:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6491src" href="#xd26e6491" name="xd26e6491src">37</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Hardly had said evacuation of Iligan taken
place on the 28th of last month, when the Moros or Mohammedans of the
interior, our mortal enemies since times immemorial on account of their
religious fanaticism which they carry to extremes, as do their
co-religionists in Europe and Asia, and on account of their objection
to leading a civilized life, began to harry the town of Iligan which is
the nearest town to the lake around which is the densest Moro
population. Due to the prestige of the local president of that town,
Se&ntilde;or Carloto Sariol, and the energy that he showed, after some
days of constant firing against groups who descended upon the suburbs
of the town, he was successful in having them abandon their hostile
attitude and promise to live in peace and harmony with said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>towns, this verbal agreement being participated
in by the Dattos of some settlements who did not wish to treat with the
Spanish Government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being acquainted nevertheless with these people, we know by
experience that the more friendly they appear, the more we must watch
against them, because as soon as they find a good opportunity they do
not fail to take advantage of it to enter the towns for the purpose of
sacking them and kidnapping as many of their inhabitants as possible in
order to reduce them to slavery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the abandonment of Cotabato by the Spaniards the
Filipino residents set up a government there. A few days later the Moro
datos, Piang, Ali and Djimbangan, dropped in with their followers, cut
off the head of the Filipino <i>presidente</i>, served a few other
leading officials and citizens in the same manner, and proceeded to set
up a government of their own which was the only government that the
place had prior to the arrival of the American troops.</p>
<p>Dato Djimbangan promptly caused the Filipina women of the place to
be stripped and compelled to march before him on the public plaza in a
state of nudity.</p>
<p>At Zamboanga the Moros could have taken the town at any time after
the Spaniards left had they desired to do so. On the arrival of the
Americans Dato Mandi offered to take it and turn it over to them, but
his proposition was declined.</p>
<p>He subsequently swore to an affidavit relative to conditions under
Insurgent rule. It reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We always had peace in Zamboanga District;
except during the revolution of the Filipinos in the year 1899, when
for seven or eight months there was in existence the so-called Filipino
Republic. During that time there was much robbing and killing; the life
of a man was worth no more than that of a chicken; men killed one
another for personal gain; enemies fought one another with the bolo
instead of settling their differences before the law. It was a time of
bloodshed and terror. There was no justice. Because of this the Moros
were opposed to the Filipinos. There was conflict between the better
class <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>of Filipinos and the revolutionists, who had
gained control of the local government.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6519src" href="#xd26e6519" name="xd26e6519src">38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere throughout the Moro territory those Filipinos who did not
promptly make their escape were murdered or enslaved. In short, the
lion and the lamb lay down together, with the lamb inside as usual.</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that this first and last attempt of Filipinos
to govern Moros did not result in complete success.</p>
<p>Baldomero Aguinaldo made a subsequent attempt to open communication
with the Sultan of Jol&oacute;, authorizing him to establish in all the
<i>rancherias</i> of Mindanao and Jol&oacute; a government in
accordance with a decree duly transmitted. The Sultan was requested to
report the result of his efforts and to give the number of his forces
with their arms, and was advised that, &ldquo;if in this war, which I
consider to be the last, we secure our independence and with the
opposition of our brothers in that region, with yourself at their head,
we are successful in preventing the enemy from gaining a foothold, the
grateful country will always render a tribute of homage and gratitude
to your memory.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6531src" href=
"#xd26e6531" name="xd26e6531src">39</a> Curiously, the Sultan seems to
have remained unmoved by the appeal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Masbate</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This tight little island of 1236 square miles had in
1903 a Visayan population of 29,451. Its people are all Filipinos, and
are on the whole rather an unusually orderly and worthy set. There is
no reason why it should have been excluded in considering &ldquo;the
human problem in its broader governmental aspect,&rdquo; whatever that
may be, nor can I understand why Blount should have desired to exclude
it except that he seems to have been endeavouring to exclude everything
possible outside of Luz&oacute;n, in order to increase the apparent
importance of the Christian provinces of that island. Masbate should of
course be taken into account in connection with the Visayan Islands, of
which it is one.</p>
<p>The islands ordinarily included in the group known as &ldquo;The
Visayas&rdquo; from the ancient tribal name of the civilized Filipino
people who inhabit them, who are called Visayans, are Samar, Panay,
Negros, Leyte, Ceb&uacute;, Bohol, Masbate, Tablas, Romblon, Ticao,
Burias, Siquijor and numerous smaller islands adjacent to those named.
Although their inhabitants are all rated as one people, they speak a
number of more or less distinct dialects. Only Panay, Negros, Samar,
Tablas and Sibuyan have non-Christian inhabitants, and in the three
islands last named their number is so small as to be negligible. In the
mountains of Panay and Negros, however, Negritos are to be found in
considerable numbers, as are the representatives of a tribe sometimes
called <i>Monteses</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6566src" href=
"#xd26e6566" name="xd26e6566src">40</a> and sometimes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>Bukidnon. The latter tribal designation I have
thought it best to reserve for certain inhabitants of northern
Mindanao.</p>
<p>In the Visayas, Palawan and Mindanao the government of Aguinaldo was
established at various places and different times, without consulting
or considering the will of the people. The men who went as his
delegates were supported by armed forces, hence their authority was not
at first questioned, but soon there arose murmurings which might easily
have grown into a war cry.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Visayan Filipinos is clearly foreshadowed in the
following extract from a letter dated January 14, 1899, in which Mabini
discussed the advisability of putting the constitution in
force:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;And even if this change is made, I fear that
Negros and Ilo&iacute;lo will form a federal Republic and not one in
conformity with the centralized Republic provided for by the
Constitution.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6578src" href=
"#xd26e6578" name="xd26e6578src">41</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The action later taken by Negros shows that there was abundant
reason for this fear.</p>
<p>As late as February 26, 1899, the Insurgent government was still
ignorant as to the real conditions in Negros and Mindanao.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6585src" href="#xd26e6585" name=
"xd26e6585src">42</a></p>
<p>From a letter written on March 18, 1899, to Apacible at Hongkong, we
learn that Aguinaldo and his followers were even then still uninformed
as to events in the Visayan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>Islands.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6597src" href="#xd26e6597" name="xd26e6597src">43</a> In view of
these facts, how ridiculous become the contentions of those who claim
that the Malolos government represented the archipelago as a whole. And
what shall we say of the following statement, remembering that the
Treaty of Paris was signed December 10, 1899?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;When the Treaty of Paris was signed, General
Otis was in possession of Cavite and Manila, with less than twenty
thousand men under his command, and Aguinaldo was in possession of
practically all of the rest of the archipelago with between 35,000 and
40,000 men under his command, armed with guns, and the whole Filipino
population were in sympathy with the army of their
country.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6603src" href="#xd26e6603"
name="xd26e6603src">44</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, by one means or another, and chiefly by the use of armed
emissaries, the Visayan Islands, with the exception of Negros, were
brought into the Insurgent fold.</p>
<div class="figure p031width" id="p031"><img src="images/p031.jpg" alt=
"A Typical Baguio Road" width="720" height="426">
<p class="figureHead">A Typical Baguio Road</p>
<p class="first">The roads in Baguio were originally built with money
obtained from the sale of lots. Some insular government funds have been
expended in surfacing them.</p>
</div>
<p>Mabini&rsquo;s fear that Negros and Iloilo would form a federal
republic was not realized, but Negros set up its own government,
applied to the local commander of the United States forces for help,
endeavoured with almost complete success to keep out Tag&aacute;log
invaders, and presently settled down contentedly under American rule,
facts of which Blount makes no mention. On the contrary, without just
cause, he includes this great island, with its 4881 square miles of
territory and its 560,776 inhabitants, in the area over which he claims
that Aguinaldo exercised complete control.</p>
<p>At Iloilo the American troops encountered opposition when they
planned to land. Negotiations had been entered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>into
with the local Filipino officers, but the latter, under the influence
of representatives whom Aguinaldo had sent from Luz&oacute;n, announced
themselves as adherents of his government, and when the American troops
finally disembarked fired the town ahead of them. It has been claimed
that in doing this they were inspired by pure patriotism, but the facts
shown by their own records present a very different picture.</p>
<p>In writing to Aguinaldo on April 8, 1899, Mabini says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We have received a communication forwarded from
Ilo&iacute;lo, from General Martin Delgado and Francisco Soriano, your
commissioner. Soriano states that the troops of Diocno have done
nothing except commit excesses and steal money during the attack by the
Americans upon the town of Ilo&iacute;lo, even going so far as to break
their guns by using them as poles to carry the stolen money which they
took to C&aacute;piz. It is said that these forces, besides being
unwilling to fight the Americans, refuse to give their guns to those
who do wish to fight and do not want C&aacute;piz to aid the people of
Ilo&iacute;lo, who are the ones who support the entire forces,
including the troops of Diocno who went there.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6627src" href="#xd26e6627" name="xd26e6627src">45</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same letter contains the following brief reference to
conditions in Cebu and Leyte:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Also a native priest, Se&ntilde;or Pascual
Reyes, has arrived here from Ceb&uacute;, and says that in Leyte
General Lucban is committing many abuses and that Colonel M&oacute;jica
is only a mere figurehead. In Ceb&uacute;, he says, things are also in
a chaotic condition, because the military chief, Magsilum
[Maxilom,&mdash;TR.], and the people are not in harmony.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further details as to conditions in Cebu are given in a letter to
Aguinaldo from the commissioner whom he put in charge of elections in
that island, who on February 19, 1899, writes:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6638src" href="#xd26e6638" name="xd26e6638src">46</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Having arrived in this province the 8th of last
month, I left on the 11th for the northern pueblos of this Island to
hold the elections for the offices ordered by the Superior Decree of
June 18, last.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The news spread like an electric spark, as in all the pueblos
I visited later I found that almost all of the residents were in their
homes, so that when the elections were held in the town hall, all the
principal residents attended, requesting me to inform you that they
were disposed to sacrifice even their dearest affections whenever
necessary for our sacred cause; they only asked me to inform those who
hold the reins of government at the present time in this province, that
some steps be taken to put a stop to the arbitrary acts which had been
and still are being committed by the so-called Captains, Majors,
Colonels, Generals and Captains General, who abusing in the most
barefaced manner the positions they claimed to hold, were depriving
them of their horses and their carabaos, or cattle. I promised them
that I would do this, as I do now, by sending a communication at once
to Sres. Flores and Maxilom, who are at the head of the provincial
government, impressing upon them the fact that if they continue to
grant ranks and titles to persons of this character, as they have done,
it would end in the utter ruin of this wealthy province.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds that these men did not remedy the evils complained of. It
would be possible to cover in detail all of this and the remaining
Insurgent territory, and to show that Judge Blount was quite right in
stating that conditions similar to those encountered in Luz&oacute;n
arose there, but the limitations of time and space forbid, and I must
ask my readers to accept on faith the statements of Blount and myself
that such was the case!</p>
<p>Taylor thus summarizes the conditions which ultimately
arose:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Insurgent soldiers lived in their own land
as they would have lived in a conquered country. They were quartered on
the towns and the towns had to feed them whether they would or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace there was where Aguinaldo&rsquo;s soldiers had not
penetrated, but there does not seem to have been progress. Life went
very well in a long siesta in the shady villages under the palm trees,
but not only the structure of the State, its very foundations were
falling apart. When Aguinaldo&rsquo;s soldiers came they brought
cruelty and license with them. Proud of their victories and confident
in themselves they felt that the labourers in the fields, the merchants
in the towns, were for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>purpose of administering to their
necessities and their desires. Aguinaldo, having seen this force gather
about him, was forced to entreat it, to appeal to it; he was never
strong enough to enforce discipline, even if he cared to do
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo himself finally became disheartened over his inability to
maintain a decent state of public order in the territory which he
claimed to govern, and in December, 1898, tendered his resignation,
giving among other reasons odious favouritism on the part of some of
the military chiefs, together with a desire to enrich themselves by
improper means, such as accepting bribes, making prisoners a source of
gain, and decreasing the allowance of the soldiers. He said that many
soldiers had received sums of money as their share of booty, and
intimated that officers must have done the same. He made charges
against civil as well as military officers and ended by saying that he
retained the evidence for presentation when called on.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6666src" href="#xd26e6666" name=
"xd26e6666src">47</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>Aguinaldo was later persuaded to withdraw his resignation. No wonder
that he wished to tender it!</p>
<p>In referring to the report of Wilcox and Sargent, Blount has
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This report was submitted by them to Admiral
Dewey under date of November 23, 1898, and by him forwarded to the Navy
Department for its information, with the comment that it &lsquo;in my
opinion contains the most complete and reliable information obtainable
in regard to the present state of the northern part of Luzon
Island.&rsquo; The Admiral&rsquo;s indorsement was not sent to the
Senate along with the report.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6686src" href="#xd26e6686" name="xd26e6686src">48</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He thus gives it to be understood that the admiral believed that the
report truthfully set forth the conditions which actually existed in
these provinces, and that his indorsement was suppressed. Not only was
it true that this report when rendered contained the most complete and
reliable information then available in regard to the existing state of
the northern part of Luzon Island, but it contained the only first-hand
information available. The facts ultimately leaked out and led the
admiral radically to change his opinion as to the conditions which
arose under Insurgent rule. Of them he later said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;There was a sort of a reign of terror; there
was no government. These people had got power for the first time in
their lives and they were riding roughshod over the community. The acts
of cruelty which were brought to my notice were hardly credible. I sent
word to Aguinaldo that he must treat his prisoners kindly, and he said
he would.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that I have fully demonstrated the truth of these
statements. Blount was thoroughly familiar with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>Dewey&rsquo;s testimony before the Senate
Committee, in which they occur, but he did not mention them.</p>
<p>I cannot close this discussion of Insurgent rule without quoting
extracts from a remarkable document written by Isabelo Artacho in
October,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6702src" href="#xd26e6702" name=
"xd26e6702src">49</a> 1899. It was entitled &ldquo;Declaration Letter
and Proclamation&rdquo; and was addressed to the Filipino people. While
it is probable that Artacho was impelled to tell the truth by his
hatred for Aguinaldo, tell the truth he did, and his rank and standing
entitle his statements to consideration:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Study the work of the insurrection; see if it
is, as is said, the faithful interpretation of your wishes and
desires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go through your towns, fields, and mountains. Wherever you
see an insurgent gun or bolo you will find girls and faithful wives
violated, parents and brothers crying for the murder of a son or of a
brother; honest families robbed and in misery; villages burned and
plundered for the benefit of a chief or a General; you will see fresh
and living signs yet of those horrible crimes perpetrated with the
greatest cynicism by those who call themselves your liberators!
Liberators because they wear red pants, or a red shirt, or carry on
their hats a piece of red cloth or a triangular figure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, a president stabs a man, perhaps the most honest of the
village, simply for having implored mercy for a creature arbitrarily
inflicted with the <i>cepo</i> [an oblong square piece of heavy wood
divided into two parts, with a lock at each end and six or more holes
in the middle to confine the feet of prisoners]; there, a dying man,
suspended by the feet in a <i>cepo</i>, raised from the level of the
ground, by another president who has charged him with an unproved
crime; there a poor woman falsely charged and driven by petty officers
with their bayonets for having objected to their invasion into her
house, or shop, they being supposed to be, each, Justice itself,
&lsquo;<i>Justicia</i>,&rsquo; and to be obeyed as images of the Gods;
there, generals who murder without fear, for an insignificant motive,
creatures whose members are being mutilated, or their flesh cut in
slices and afterwards roasted and given them to eat; there, officers
braining a girl who has refused to accede to their sensual wishes, the
lifeless body of the victim, pierced with shots, after having been made
use of, is thrown into the river. It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>not unusual to
witness officers burying people alive in a tomb prepared by the victim,
by order of the murderer; it is not unusual to see a
<i>Puisne</i>-Judge pointing a revolver at a man who is about to give
evidence, and threatening to brain him for having dared to ask:
&lsquo;Why and to whom am I to declare?&rsquo; And finally, on his
tottering throne, you will see the Magistrate of the Philippines, so
called by his worshippers, with his mephistophelian smile, disposing
and directing the execution of a murder, of a plunder, of a robbery, or
the execution of some other crimes against those who are indifferent or
do not care to worship him, such indifference being considered a
crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting aside the many other murders, I may mention that one
recently committed on the person of the renowned and by many called the
worthy General, Antonio Luna, which took place just at the entrance of
the palace of the Republic Presidency, and also the assassination at
Kavite of the ever remembered martyr, Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, the
founder of the &lsquo;Katip&uacute;nan&rsquo; Society, and the one who
initiated the Revolution of 1896; against the memory of whom it has
been committed, in the proclamation of that falsely called Republic,
the criminal and unjust omission to render the smallest manifestation
of Filipinos&rsquo; feelings towards him, to prevent that same might
dislike his murderers!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Study the ordinances and constitution of this so-called
democratic Government of the Republic, that grand work of the wise
Filipinos; admire with me that beautiful monument erected on a sheet of
paper and consecrated to the conquest of reason and labour, especially
in connection with human rights and property, the basis for the
well-being of social life; but, lament and deplore with me its palpable
nullity when brought to practice and you will again see that the laws
were made for the people and not the people for the laws!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under this republic called democratic it is a crime to think,
to wish, to say, anything which does not agree with what the said Gods
think, wish and say. Nobody and nothing is attended to, whilst those
who have your lives in their hands must be respected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under this Goverment there cannot be the slightest notice
taken of family, property, morality and justice, but confusion and
disorder appear everywhere like a dreadful shadow, produced by the
ignorance of the subordinate officers, and of the powers that be in the
villages and provinces, who are supported by a special committee, or
special commissioners empowered to impoverish and to ruin all and with
the right of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>disposing, at their own accord, life, family and
individual property without responsibility whatsoever on their
part.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Let the peaceful annexation of the whole of the Southern
Islands of Jol&oacute;, Mindanao, Ilo&iacute;lo, Negros, Ceb&uacute;
and others where now the American flag is hoisted and under whose
shadow tranquillity and well-being are experienced, speak for
itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it speak for itself, the proceeding observed by the whole
people of Imus, who were asking protection when the American troops
took possession of the town of Bacoor, whilst the insurgent troops
there located were hostile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them speak for themselves, the protests against the war
made by the numerous persons of S. Francisco de Malab&oacute;n, Sta.
Cruz de Malab&oacute;n, Perez Dasmari&ntilde;ias and other towns,
before the Worthy Chief Mariano Tr&iacute;as, who ultimately refused,
with dignity, the high position of Secretary of War, for which rank he
was promoted for reasons which are not worth publishing here. In fine,
let it speak for itself, the non-resistance shown by the people of Old
Kavite [Kawit], Noveleta, and Rozario of the heroic province of Kavite,
notwithstanding the many intrenchments and troops there located, as
well as the identical behaviour observed by other towns of Luzon
provinces who are ready to follow when the American troops are in
them.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;In fact no one would believe it, and the Philippine people
are tired of waiting for the day when Haring Gavino will shake a napkin
to produce suddenly horses vomiting fire and lightning and troops of
dangerous insects; that day in which they will witness the realization
of that famous telegraphed dream to the effect that two hours after the
commencement of the war the insurgents will take their breakfast in the
Palace of &lsquo;Malaca&ntilde;ang,&rsquo; their tiffin in the Senate
House, and their dinner on board the <i>Olympia</i> or in Kavite; that
day in which the celebrated <i>Pequenines</i> army, with their
invisible Chief-leader, will exterminate the American troops by means
of handfuls of dust and sand thrown at them, which process, it is said,
has caused the smallpox to the Americans; that day in which the
<i>Colorum</i> army will capture the American fleet with the cords
their troops are provided with, in combination with a grand
intrenchment of Tayabas made of husks of paddy, by a Nazarene, who will
then, by merely touching, convert each <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

a deadly sting; that day in which the insurgents, like their leaders,
provided with hosts of flour, or of paper, pieces of candles of the
holy-week matins, holy water, pieces of consecrated stones; of
vestments belonging to a miraculous Saint or with some other
Anting-Anting or talisman or <i>amuletos</i>, will make themselves
invulnerable to bullets; also have power to convert into any of the
four elements, like those personages of the Philippine legends and
comedies,&mdash;Ygmidio, Te&ntilde;oso, Florante, Barnardo, Carpio,

<p>Most of the men who perpetrated the outrages I have detailed are
alive to-day, and are powers in their respective communities. Simeon
Villa was recently elected a member of the municipal board from the
south district of Manila, but fortunately an American governor-general
prevented him from taking his seat. Just prior to my departure from
Manila he was appointed, by Speaker Osme&ntilde;a, a member of a
committee on reception for Governor-General Harrison.</p>

I do not mean to say that such a state of affairs would come about
immediately, but it would certainly arise within a comparatively short
time. Sooner yet &ldquo;the united Filipino people&rdquo; would split
up on old tribal lines, and fly at each other&rsquo;s throats.

committed by them; and if this be not done, the petitioners will be

confessed to the government as to having received certain sums in the

<h2 class="main">Did We Destroy a Republic?</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The claim has frequently been made that the United
States government destroyed a republic in the Philippine
Islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6803src" href="#xd26e6803" name=
"xd26e6803src">1</a> but some of the critics seem to entertain peculiar
ideas as to what a republic is. Blount states<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6813src" href="#xd26e6813" name="xd26e6813src">2</a> that
Aguinaldo declined to hear our declaration of independence read
&ldquo;because we would not recognize his right to assert the same
truths,&rdquo; and then apparently forgetting the Insurgent
chief&rsquo;s alleged adherence to the principles of this document, he
lets the cat out of the bag by saying that &ldquo;the war satisfied us
all that Aguinaldo would have been a small edition of Porfirio
Diaz,&rdquo; and would himself have been &ldquo;The
Republic.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6816src" href="#xd26e6816"
name="xd26e6816src">3</a></p>
<p>He would doubtless have set up just this sort of a government, if
not assassinated too soon, but it would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>hardly have accorded
with the principles of the declaration of independence, nor would it
have been exactly &ldquo;a government of the people, by the people, for
the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blount truly says<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6825src" href=
"#xd26e6825" name="xd26e6825src">4</a> that the educated Filipinos,
admittedly very few in number, absolutely control the masses. He
adds<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6828src" href="#xd26e6828" name=
"xd26e6828src">5</a> that <i>presidentes</i> of pueblos are as absolute
bosses as is Murphy in Tammany Hall, and that the towns taken
collectively constitute the provinces. The first statement is true, and
the second, which is tantamount to a declaration that the
<i>presidentes</i> control every square foot of the provinces and every
man in them, is not so far from the truth as it might be. I have been
old-fashioned enough to retain the idea that a republic is &ldquo;a
state in which the sovereign power resides in the whole body of the
people, and is exercised by representatives elected by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blount labored under no delusion as to the fitness of the common
people to govern.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6839src" href="#xd26e6839"
name="xd26e6839src">6</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not only did the Filipinos themselves understand perfectly well that
they had no republic, but there were many of them who were fully aware
of the fact that they could establish none. Fernando Acevedo, in
writing to General P&iacute;o del Pilar on August 8, 1898,
said:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6861src" href="#xd26e6861" name=
"xd26e6861src">7</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;There could be no republic here, even though
the Americans should consent, because, according to the treaties, the
Filipinos are not in condition for a republic. Besides this, all Europe
will oppose it, and if it should be that they divide our country as
though it were a round cake, what would become of us and what would
belong to us?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will now trace the evolution of the government which Aguinaldo did
set up. In doing so I follow Taylor&rsquo;s argument very closely,
drawing on his unpublished Ms., not only for ideas, but in some
instances for the words in which they are clothed. I change his words
in many cases, and do not mean to unload on him any responsibility for
my statements, but do wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to him and at
the same time to avoid the necessity for the continual use of quotation
marks.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s methods in establishing his republic are shown by
his order<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6872src" href="#xd26e6872" name=
"xd26e6872src">8</a> that &ldquo;any person who fights for his country
has absolute power to kill any one not friendly to our cause&rdquo; and
the further order<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6875src" href="#xd26e6875"
name="xd26e6875src">9</a> prescribing that twelve lashes should be
given to a soldier who lost even a single cartridge, while if he
continued to waste ammunition he should be severely punished. In March,
1899, workmen who had abandoned their work in the arsenal at Malolos
were arrested, returned, given twenty-five lashes each and then ordered
to work.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6878src" href="#xd26e6878" name=

<p>The news that an American expedition was about to sail for the
Philippines made him realize that he had not much more than a month in
which to place himself in a position in which he would have to be
consulted and assisted, and this he tried to do. The arms he received
from Hongkong on May 23 enabled him to begin an insurrection, not as an
ally of the United States, but on his own account. From May 21 to May
24 he issued orders for the uprising against Spain. On May 24 he
declared himself Dictator of the Philippines in a proclamation in which
he promised to resign his power into the hands of a president and
cabinet, to be appointed when a constitutional assembly was convened,
which would be as soon as the islands had passed into his control. He
further announced that the North American nation had given its
disinterested protection in order that the liberty of the Philippines
should be gained.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6884src" href="#xd26e6884"
name="xd26e6884src">11</a> On May 25, 1898, the first American troops
sailed from San Francisco for the Philippines.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo still had a month in which to seize enough Spanish
territory to erect thereon what would appear to the Americans on their
arrival to be a government of Luz&oacute;n, of which he was the head.
The Hongkong junta and Aguinaldo himself intended to ask for the
recognition of their government, but they had first to create it. To
obtain recognition it was necessary that the American commander on land
should be able to report that wherever he or his troops had gone the
country was ruled by Aguinaldo according to laws which showed that the
people were capable of governing themselves.</p>
<p>As the United States is a republic it was natural that the directing
group of insurgent leaders should decide upon a republican form of
government. That form would appeal to the people of the United States;
the first &ldquo;Christian Asiatic Republic&rdquo; was a description
which would inevitably awaken sympathy in that mother of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>republics. The idea was a wise and subtle one;
but Aguinaldo&rsquo;s republic was merely an elaborate stage-setting,
arranged for the contemplation of the people of the United States.</p>
<p>By June 5, 1898, the success of the insurgent arms had been such
that Aguinaldo felt that he could throw down the mask. He would still
be glad of American assistance, but he felt himself strong enough to do
without it. He saw that &ldquo;there can now be proclaimed before the
Filipino people and the civilized nations its only aspiration, namely,
the independence of this country, which proclamation should not be
delayed for any ulterior object of this government&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6896src" href="#xd26e6896" name=
"xd26e6896src">12</a> and ordered that the independence of the
Philippines should be proclaimed at his birthplace, Cavite Viejo, on
June 12, 1898. On that date he formally proclaimed it. The provinces of
Cavite, Bataan, Pampanga, Batangas, Bulacan, Laguna and Morong were
about to fall into his hands, the Spanish troops in them being
besieged, and about to surrender.</p>
<p>From the same place on June 18, 1898, Aguinaldo promulgated his
decree for the creation and administration of municipalities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6901src" href="#xd26e6901" name=
"xd26e6901src">13</a> In brief, this provided that as soon as the
territory of the archipelago, or any portion thereof, had passed from
the possession of Spanish forces, the people in the towns who were most
conspicuous for their intelligence, social position and upright conduct
were to meet and elect a town government. The heads of the towns in
every province were to elect a head for the province and his three
counsellors. The provincial council, composed of these four officials,
with the presidente of the capital of the province, were to see to the
execution in that province of the decrees of the central government and
to advise and suggest.</p>
<p>This provincial council was to elect representatives for the
revolutionary congress, which was to be charged with submitting
suggestions to the central government <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>upon interior and
exterior affairs, and was to be heard by the government upon serious
matters which admitted of delay and discussion.</p>
<p>Before any person elected to office was permitted to discharge his
functions, his election was to be approved by the central government.
The military commanders, except in time of war, were to have no
jurisdiction over the civil authorities. They could, however, demand
such supplies as they might need, and these could not be refused. The
government was to appoint commissioners to carry these regulations into
effect.</p>
<p>On June 20 Aguinaldo issued his regulations for the government of
provinces and municipalities<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6914src" href=
"#xd26e6914" name="xd26e6914src">14</a> as supplemental to the decree
of two days before. It went into the details of government, under the
following heads: police, justice, taxation and registration of
property.</p>
<p>On June 23 he proclaimed the establishment of a revolutionary
government, with himself as &ldquo;president.&rdquo; In this capacity
he had all the powers of the Spanish governor-general, unhampered by
any orders from Spain. It is true that the scheme provided for the
eventual formation of a republic, but it is doubtful if the people who
drew it up really knew what that word meant. What was provided for in
practice was a strong and highly centralized military dictatorship, in
which, under the form of election, provision was made for the filling
of all offices by men devoted to the group which had seized
control.</p>
<p>According to this decree the dictatorial government was in future to
be entitled the revolutionary government. Its duty was to struggle for
the independence of the Philippines in order to establish a true
republic. The dictator was to be known as the president of the
revolutionary government. There were to be four secretaries&mdash;one
of foreign affairs, commerce and marine; one of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>war
and public works; one of police and interior order, justice, education
and hygiene; one of the treasury, agriculture and manufactures. The
government could increase the number of secretaries if necessary. They
were to assist the president in the despatch of business coming under
their departments.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Typical Cottages at Baguio</p>
<p class="first">Cottages of this type are used by officers of the
government.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to the president and his secretaries, there was to be a
revolutionary congress composed of representatives from the provinces
of the Philippine Archipelago, elected as provided by the decree of
June 18. In case a province was not able to elect representatives, the
government would appoint them for such province. The congress was to
discuss and advise, to approve treaties and loans, and to examine and
approve the accounts of the secretary of the treasury. If important
matters admitted of delay, the congress would be heard concerning them;
but if they did not admit of delay, the president of the government was
to act at once. Projects of law could be presented by any
representative, and by the secretaries of the government.</p>
<p>A permanent committee of congress presided over by the
vice-president was to be chosen by that body. This was to serve as a
court of appeal in criminal cases and as a court of final jurisdiction
in cases arising between the secretaries of the government and
provincial officials. The acts of congress were not to go into effect
until the president of the government ordered their execution. He was
also to have the right of veto.</p>
<p>This was a well-devised plan to secure control for the central group
about Aguinaldo. His commissioners, under a form of election in which
the electors were carefully selected men, established municipal
governments devoted to the cause of the revolution. These were to
choose provincial officials and members of the congress. All elections
were subject to Aguinaldo&rsquo;s approval, and every province was
under the command of a military representative of his, who could and
did call upon the civil authorities for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>such supplies as he
deemed fit. All real power was vested in the central group, and the
central group was composed of Emilio Aguinaldo and his public and
private advisers. By this time he had gathered about him men who were
trained in the law, some of whom had served the Spanish government in
various capacities. They were accustomed to the methods that had
previously prevailed under the Spanish r&eacute;gime, and were now
ready to draw up constitutions and regulations for the new government.
Mabini wrote the three organic decrees. Copies of them were sent to the
foreign consuls in Manila, and on July 15, 1898 to Admiral Dewey.</p>
<p>Although the title of &ldquo;president&rdquo; was assumed by
Aguinaldo, as more likely to be favourably considered in the United
States than &ldquo;dictator,&rdquo; the tendency of his followers who
had not been educated in Europe was to speak of and to regard him not
as a president, but as an overlord holding all power in his hands. The
people did not feel themselves citizens of a republic, copartners in an
estate; they considered themselves subject to a ruler who sometimes
called himself president, and sometimes dictator. Indeed, there is much
to show that if Aguinaldo and his followers had succeeded in their
plans, even the name &ldquo;republic&rdquo; would not have been long
continued as the title of his government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6941src" href="#xd26e6941" name="xd26e6941src">15</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s claim as to the effectiveness of his government on
August 6, 1898, was as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6954src"
href="#xd26e6954" name="xd26e6954src">16</a> &ldquo;The government of
the revolution actually rules in the provinces of Cavite, Batangas,
Mindoro, Tayabas, Laguna, Morong, Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Infanta
and besieges the capital, Manila. The most perfect order and
tranquillity reign in these provinces, governed by authorities elected
by the inhabitants in conformity with the organic decrees dated June 18
and 23 last. Moreover, the revolution has about nine thousand prisoners
of war who are treated humanely and according to the rules of civilized
warfare. We can muster more than thirty thousand men organized as a
regular army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may have been that in the majority of these provinces municipal
governments, formed in accordance with the provisions of the decree of
June 18, had been established; but provincial governments had not been
established in all of them, and tranquillity did not reign in any of
them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>as they were the scene of operations against the
Spaniards. There could not well have been nine thousand prisoners in
his hands at this time, as that was claimed later when a large
additional number of Spaniards had surrendered. As for the thirty
thousand men organized as a regular army, there may be a certain
difference of opinion as to what constitutes a regular army; the men
who saw Aguinaldo&rsquo;s force then, and who have read the papers of
its leaders, must be of the opinion that that force was not a regular
army. Probably only Manila Province had a provincial government on
August 6. Its local presidentes met at Cavite Viejo on August 3 and
elected three members of congress from the province, and also the
members of the provincial government. The election took place under the
supervision of Colonel Teodoro Gonzales, whom Aguinaldo had appointed
governor of Manila Province on August 1. He remained governor after the
election was held. Not until August 17 did the local presidentes of
Bulacan assemble under the presidency of the secretary of the interior
and proceed to elect two members to congress and the members of the
provincial government. Not until August 20 was there an election for
the members of the provincial government of Cavite Province. This was
held in the town of Cavite. Isaac Fernando Rios, who was afterwards a
member of the Filipino junta in Madrid, was chosen a representative of
the province; but as he wrote that he was in favour of coming to some
agreement with Spain which would permit the development of the
Philippines, without abandoning the sovereignty of that country,
Aguinaldo promptly disapproved his election<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6961src" href="#xd26e6961" name="xd26e6961src">17</a> and ordered
a new one held for the office thus left vacant. On October 2, 1899,
Aguinaldo approved the result of a new election held there because four
of the five high officials of the province had absented themselves,
while one of them had died. Of the men who had so absented themselves
one had gone abroad, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252"
name="pb252">252</a>]</span>while the other three had remained in
Manila or Cavite under the government of the United States.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6966src" href="#xd26e6966" name=
"xd26e6966src">18</a></p>
<p>The people of the provinces obeyed the men who had arms in their
hands. It is not probable that many of them had any conviction
concerning the form of government which would be best for the
Philippines. There were no signs of a spontaneous desire for a
republic. Orders came from the group about Aguinaldo, and the people
accepted a dictator and a republic as they accepted a president and a
republic, without knowing, and probably without caring very much, what
it all meant, except that they hoped that taxes would cease with the
departure of the friars. A determined and well-organized minority had
succeeded in imposing its will upon an unorganized, heterogeneous, and
leaderless majority.</p>
<p>As soon as a province was occupied by the Insurgents it was divided
into territorial zones within which command was exerted by military
officers. On July 20, 1898, Cavite had been divided into four zones,
and next day Brigadier-General Artemio Ricarte was placed in command of
the province and the first zone.</p>
<p>By July 7 Bulacan Province had been divided into six zones, and
Nueva Ecija into four zones, with a separate commander for each zone.
These men established the government prescribed by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
decrees of the middle of June. Probably by the end of July
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s municipal governments had been established in the
greater part of the towns of Luz&oacute;n. These governments were not
established by the mass of the people. The mass of the people were not
consulted, but they were not in the habit of being consulted in such
matters and probably saw no necessity for it in this case. As an
evidence of this we have the fact that from the beginning the acts of
election were almost always drawn up in Spanish, although by far the
greater portion of the people of the archipelago spoke only the native
dialects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span></p>
<p>The method of establishing these municipal governments employed in
Cavite in June, 1898, was continued to the end of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
rule. It was the same in different places and at different times. Data
obtained from reports and documents written in towns far removed from
each other follow. They must be considered together in order to obtain
an idea of what this method really was.</p>
<p>When the Insurgent movement had progressed sufficiently far, the
leaders collected their adherents and obtained recognition as the heads
of their provinces or districts. For example, representatives of the
towns of Pampanga assembled at San Fernando on June 26, 1898, and under
the presidency of General Maximo Hizon agreed to yield him
&ldquo;complete obedience as military governor of the province and
representative of the illustrious dictator of these Philippine
Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6980src" href="#xd26e6980"
name="xd26e6980src">19</a> The town of Macabebe refused to send any
delegates to this gathering. Commissioners, in almost every case
officers of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s army, were empowered by him to establish
the so-called republican government. They appointed delegates who
proceeded to the smaller towns and held elections; but whenever
possible the commissioner of Aguinaldo presided. In many cases these
delegates were lieutenants of the army. The commissioners selected the
electors, for they had all to be &ldquo;marked out by their good
conduct, their wealth, and their social position,&rdquo; and they had
all to be in favour of independence. They then presided at the
elections, which were <i>viva voce</i>. They apparently selected the
people to be elected, and forwarded a record of the proceedings to the
central government. The election had to be approved by the dictator or
president before the successful candidates could assume the duties of
their offices. Later on, the military commanders remote from the seat
of government were authorized to approve elections and install the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>successful candidates, but the records of
election had even then to be forwarded to the capital for approval, the
action of the commissioner not being final.</p>
<p>The commissioners do not seem to have been able to find many men who
had the necessary requisites for electors. In the town of Lipa,
Batangas Province, with a population of forty thousand seven hundred
forty-three, at the election held July 3, 1898, a presidente was chosen
for whom twenty-five votes were cast. On November 23, 1898, an election
was held at Vigan, Ilocos Sur, for a presidente to succeed one who had
been elected representative in congress. One hundred and sixteen votes
were cast. The population of Vigan is nineteen thousand. On October 5,
1898, at Echague, Isabela Province, a presidente was elected for whom
fifty-four votes were cast. The population of Echague is fifty-four
thousand. On October 2, 1898, at Cabagan Nuevo, Isabela, one hundred
and eleven men voted out of a population of sixty-two hundred and
forty. On January 29, 1899, the town of Hernani, in Samar, elected its
municipal officials under the supervision of V. Lukban. Fifty-four men
voted. The town has a population of twenty-five hundred and
fifty-five.</p>
<p>The elections, so-called, were not always held without protest. For
example, the town of San Jos&eacute;, Batangas, protested unavailingly
to Aguinaldo against the result of an election held at 10 P.M., in a
storm of rain. Men who had been on friendly terms with the Spaniards
were usually excluded from all participation. If in spite of the
precautions taken men were elected who were disliked by the
commissioner or his supporters, the election could be set aside on the
ground that the person elected was not an adherent of the
revolution.</p>
<p>The elections were often held in a singular manner, as in the
following case:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6995src" href="#xd26e6995"
name="xd26e6995src">20</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On August 20, 1898, four men of Tondo appeared
before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>Aguinaldo on Bacoor and announced that they were
representatives of the people of the district, who loved liberty. Then
in accordance with the directions of the president of the republic
under the supervision of the secretary of the interior, they drew lots
from a hat to decide how the offices of the head of the district,
delegate of police, delegate of the treasury and delegate of justice
were to be distributed. The decision having been made in this simple
fashion, Aguinaldo gravely approved the election as expressing the will
of the people. Perhaps it did, for they seem to have continued, at
least for a time, to obey them. On November 14, 1898, Aguinaldo again
approved an election for local officials in Tondo which since August 13
had been within the American lines.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 23 San Carlos, in Pangasin&aacute;n Province, a town of
twenty-three thousand people, elected its officials under the new form
of government. The presidente chosen was a well-known member of the
Katip&uacute;nan, and before the election was held announced his
intention of killing any one who was chosen for the position for which
he was a candidate.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7006src" href=
"#xd26e7006" name="xd26e7006src">21</a> He was accordingly elected. In
spite of this grave informality, an informality which formed one ground
for a protest on the part of some of the people of the town, Aguinaldo
approved the election.</p>
<p>On October 21, 1898, an election was held under the supervision of
the military commander in Camarines for the municipal officials of the
town of Yriga.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7011src" href="#xd26e7011"
name="xd26e7011src">22</a> The voting was oral, and a secretary wrote
down the votes for the two candidates under direction of the
commissioner, who finally announced that the candidate whose friend he
was had been elected, but without stating how many votes he had
received. This newly elected head of the town had the town crier on the
following night publish through the streets an address to the people,
in which he thanked those who had voted for him and warned those who
had not that it would be well for them to beware. The Spanish law known
as the Maura Law, which regulated the elections in the municipalities
under the Spanish government, provided for a limited electoral body,
composed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>largely of ex-officials of the municipalities.
The choosing of an electoral body by the military commander of a
district probably did not seem strange to the people. The provincial
and municipal officials were established in office by armed men, and
they were obeyed because they had been installed by armed men; but it
was a form of election to which people, as a rule, saw no reason to
object. There were, however, in many cases bitter complaints of the
abuses committed by the officers thus &ldquo;elected.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>This form of government spread with the advance of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
arms. Municipal elections were held in Tarlac in July, in Ilocos Norte
and Tayabas in August, in Benguet and the Batanes Islands in September,
1898, in Panay in December, 1898, and in Leyte and Samar in January,
1899.</p>
<p>On December 27 Antonio Luna wrote that all the provinces of
Luz&oacute;n, Mindoro, Marinduque, Masbate, and Ticao, Rombl&oacute;n,
part of Panay, the Batanes, and Babuyanes Islands were under the
jurisdiction of the insurgent government.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7029src" href="#xd26e7029" name="xd26e7029src">23</a></p>
<p>By October 7, 1898, 14 of the 36 provinces and districts into which
Luz&oacute;n had been divided by the Spanish government had civil
governors.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7034src" href="#xd26e7034" name=
"xd26e7034src">24</a> These 14 were Tag&aacute;log provinces or
provinces which the Tag&aacute;logs controlled. The other provinces
were still under military rule, and, indeed, even the provinces under
civilians were dominated by their military commanders. With the manner
of holding elections which prevailed, the governors must have been men
who were in favour of the military party in force, for otherwise they
would not have been elected.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7039src" href=
"#xd26e7039" name="xd26e7039src">25</a></p>
<p>It is not probable that the number of provinces under civil
governors much increased. If in Pangasin&aacute;n Province, where there
are many Tag&aacute;logs, organizations opposed to the rule of
Aguinaldo could cause serious disorders, as was the case, it must have
been considered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>expedient for the success of the attempt of
the Tag&aacute;logs, who form only a fifth of the population, to
dominate the archipelago, that all provinces in which an effective
majority of the people were not of that tribe, should be kept under
military rule. The municipal governments which had been established in
Luz&oacute;n were in the hands of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s adherents, or of
men who it was hoped would prove loyal to him. They were men of the
Spanish-speaking group, which has always dominated the people of the
islands. They were probably not as a rule men of means. Many of them,
perhaps most of them, had been clerks and employees under the Spanish
government, and they saw no reason for changing the methods of town
administration which had then been followed. The municipal taxes, the
estimates for expenditures, and the regulations for town government,
were but little modified from those they found in force. In many ways
such changes as were made were for the worse.</p>
<p>Once installed in power, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s officials were required
to exercise over the mass of the people about the same control that had
always been exercised over them. The governing group considered that
they were perfectly capable of providing for the welfare of the
islands, and that it was the duty of the people to obey them without
question.</p>
<p>When the insurgent force was increased in preparation for war with
the Americans a large number of municipal officials resigned, or
attempted to do so. It was not easy for a municipal official under
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government to resign. A resignation, to be accepted,
had to be accompanied by the certificate of a physician that the person
concerned was unfit to perform the duties of his office. Judging by the
record,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7052src" href="#xd26e7052" name=
"xd26e7052src">26</a> an epidemic seems to have attacked the municipal
officials in January, 1899. It is probable that they saw that war was
inevitable and that they did not wish to remain in charge of the towns
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>and be responsible for providing for the
necessities of &ldquo;the liberating army.&rdquo; In Pangasin&aacute;n
in that month men could not leave their barrios without obtaining the
permission of the headman, and in one town men who had attempted to
sell their property for the purpose of going to Manila were, on January
17, ordered to be arrested and their conduct investigated.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7057src" href="#xd26e7057" name=
"xd26e7057src">27</a></p>
<p>Aguinaldo, having established himself at Malolos, ordered the
congress provided for in his decree of June 23, 1898, to assemble at
the capital on September 15,1898, and appointed a number of provisional
representatives for provinces and islands not under his
control.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7062src" href="#xd26e7062" name=
"xd26e7062src">28</a> It has often been claimed that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
government controlled at this time the whole archipelago, except the
bay and city of Manila and the town of Cavite.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7065src" href="#xd26e7065" name="xd26e7065src">29</a></p>
<p>Blount quotes the following statement from the report of the First
Philippine Commission:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;While the Spanish troops now remained quietly
in Manila, the Filipino forces made themselves masters of the entire
island except that city.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7079src"
href="#xd26e7079" name="xd26e7079src">30</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I signed that statement, and signed it in good faith; nevertheless,
it is untrue. The Filipino forces never controlled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>the
territory now known as Ifugao, Bontoc, Kalinga or Apayao, much less
that occupied by the Negritos on the east coast of Luz&oacute;n, but
this is not all. There exists among the Insurgent records a very
important document, prepared by Mabini, showing that when the call for
the first session of the Filipino congress was issued, there were no
less than sixty-one provinces and <i>commandancias</i>, which the
Insurgents, when talking among themselves, did not even claim to
control, and twenty-one of these were in or immediately adjacent to
Luz&oacute;n.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7089src" href="#xd26e7089"
name="xd26e7089src">31</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>The men who composed this congress were among the ablest natives of
the archipelago; but representative <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>institutions mean
nothing unless they represent the people; if they do not, they are a
conscious lie devised either to deceive the people of the country or
foreign nations, and it is not possible for any system founded upon a
lie to endure. A real republic must be founded not upon a few brilliant
men to compose the governing group but upon a people trained in
self-restraint and accustomed to govern by compromise and concession,
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>by force. To endure it must be based upon a
solid foundation of self-control, of self-respect and of respect for
the rights of others upon the part of the great majority of the common
people. If it is not, the government which follows a period of tumult,
confusion and civil war will be a government of the sword. The record
the Philippine republic has left behind it contains nothing to confirm
the belief that it would have endured, even in name, if the destinies
of the islands had been left in the hands of the men who set it up.</p>
<p>The national assembly met on the appointed day in the parish church
of Barasoain, Malolos, which had been set aside for the meetings of
congress. This body probably had then more elected members than at its
subsequent meetings, but even so it contained a large number of men who
were appointed by Aguinaldo after consultation with his council to
represent provinces which they had never even seen.</p>
<p>From a &ldquo;list of representatives of the provinces and
districts, selected by election and appointment by the government up to
July 7, 1899, with incomplete list of October 6, 1899&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7541src" href="#xd26e7541" name=
"xd26e7541src">32</a> I find that there were 193 members, of whom
forty-two were elected and one hundred fifty-one were appointed. This
congress was therefore not an elective body. Was it in any sense
representative? The following table, showing the distribution of
delegates between the several peoples, will enable us to answer this
question.</p>
<p>In considering this table it must be remembered that the
relationship given between the number of delegates assigned to a given
people and the number of individuals composing it is only approximate,
as no one of these peoples is strictly limited to the provinces where
it predominates.</p>
<p>I have classified the provinces as Tag&aacute;log, Visayan, etc.,
according to census returns showing the people who form a majority of
their inhabitants in each case.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7548src"

<p>It will be noted that the Tag&aacute;log provinces had eighteen out
of a total of forty-two elected delegates. The Visayans, by far the
most numerous people in the islands, did not have one. The
non-Christian provinces had a very disproportionately large total of
delegates, of whom four are put down as elected, but on examination we
find that one of these is from Lepanto, the capital of which was an
Ilocano town; one is from Nueva Vizcaya, where there is a considerable
Cagayan-Ilocano population; one is from Benguet, the capital of which
was an Ilocano town, and one from Tiagan, which was an Iloeano
settlement. These delegates should therefore really be credited to the
Ilocanos.</p>
<p>If the individual relationships of the several members are
considered, the result is even more striking. Of the thirty-eight
delegates assigned to the non-Christian provinces, one only, good old
Lino Abaya of Tiagan, was a non-Christian. Many of the non-Christian
<i>comandancias</i> were given a number of delegates wholly
disproportionate to their population, and in this way the congress was
stuffed full of Tag&aacute;logs.</p>
<p>Think of Filipe Buencamino, of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s cabinet,
representing the Moros of Zamboanga; of the mild, scholarly botanist
Leon Guerrero representing the Moros, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>Bagobos, Mandayas and
Manobos of Davao; of Jos&eacute; M. Lerma, the unscrupulous politician
of the province of Bataan, just across the bay from Manila,
representing the wild Moros of Cotabato; of Juan Tuason, a timid
Chinese <i>mestizo</i> Manila business man, representing the Yacan and
Samal Moros of Basilan; of my good friend Benito Legarda, since a
member of the Philippine Commission, and a resident delegate from the
Philippines to the congress of the United States, representing the
bloody Moros of Jolo! Yet they appear as representatives of these
several regions.</p>

<p class="first">This hospital, built on a picturesque site in the
midst of imposing mountain scenery, where it gets the full sweep of the
cool pine-scented breezes, has done wonderful work. Note the
tuberculosis cottages on the crest of the ridge.</p>
</div>
<p>Few, indeed, of the delegates from non-Christian territory had ever
set foot in the provinces or <i>comandancias</i> from which they were
appointed, or would have been able to so much as name the wild tribe or
tribes inhabiting them.</p>
<p>I have been furnished a list, made up with all possible care by
competent persons, from which it appears that there were eighty-five
delegates actually present at the opening of congress, of whom
fifty-nine were Tag&aacute;logs, five Bicols, three Pampangans, two
Visayans, and one a Zambalan. For the others there are no data
available. Yet it has been claimed that this was a representative body!
It was a Tag&aacute;log body, without enough representatives of any
other one of the numerous Philippine peoples to be worth
mentioning.</p>
<p>With a congress thus organized, Aguinaldo should have had no
difficulty in obtaining any legislation he desired.</p>
<p>The committee of congress appointed to draw up a constitution set to
work promptly, and by October 16,1898, had proceeded so far with their
work that Buencamino was able to write to Aguinaldo that while he had
been of the opinion that it would have been best for him to continue as
a dictator aided by a committee of able men, yet it would now be a blow
to the prestige of congress to suspend its sessions. Aguinaldo noted
upon this letter the fact that he did not approve of a
constitution.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7692src" href="#xd26e7692"
name="xd26e7692src">34</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>Apparently early in December the committee submitted their project.
In presenting it to congress they said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7698src" href="#xd26e7698" name="xd26e7698src">35</a>
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The work whose results the commission has the
honour to present for the consideration of congress has been largely a
matter of selection; in executing it not only has the French
constitution been used, but also those of Belgium, Mexico, Brazil,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala, as we have considered those
nations as most resembling the Filipino people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important difference between this project and the actual
constitution adopted was that, although the project provided that the
Dominican, Recollect, Franciscan and Augustinian friars should be
expelled from the country and that their estates should become the
property of the state, yet it recognized the Catholic religion as that
of the state and forbade state contribution to the support of any
other, although it permitted the practice in private of any religion
not opposed to morality, which did not threaten the safety of the
country. The government was authorized to negotiate a concordat with
the Pope for the regulation of the relations between church and state.
A strong party was in favour of this recognition, but it finally failed
of adoption, and the constitution as promulgated provided for the
freedom and equality of religion and for free and compulsory education
which had not been provided for in the original project. The
constitution as approved forbade the granting of titles of nobility,
decorations or honorary titles by the state to any Filipino. This
paragraph did not exist in the original project, which merely forbade
any Filipino to accept them without the consent of the government.</p>
<p>Mabini, the ablest of all Aguinaldo&rsquo;s advisers, did not
approve of the constitution. He himself had drawn up a project for a
constitution during June, 1898, but it was not accepted by the
committee, the greater part of whom were Catholics and for that reason
opposed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>Mabini, who was a bitter antagonist of that
church. And yet when separation of church and state was finally
provided for it did not please Mabini, who, although he was opposed to
church control, wrote to Aguinaldo<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7711src"
href="#xd26e7711" name="xd26e7711src">36</a> that the constitution as
passed by congress was not acceptable and should not be promulgated
because the constitutional guarantees of individual liberty could not
be maintained, as the army had to be in control for the time being, and
furthermore it was not expedient to separate church and state, as this
separation would alienate many of their adherents. Indeed, there was
not much in the constitution which he thought ought to take immediate
effect,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7714src" href="#xd26e7714" name=
"xd26e7714src">37</a> and he wrote that congress was ill-disposed
toward him because he had refused to agree to its promulgation.
Existing conditions were such that he believed that all powers should
be vested in one person. He warned Aguinaldo that if the constitution
were put in force, he would be at the mercy of his secretaries. On
January 1, 1899, Aguinaldo, probably at the suggestion of Mabini,
proposed certain changes in it.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7719src"
href="#xd26e7719" name="xd26e7719src">38</a></p>
<p>Evidently the provisions of the constitution did not worry Aguinaldo
much, as is shown by his reply to the request by some of his officers
for information as to what reward those who were first in the attack on
Manila should receive. He promised them such titles as marquis, duke,
etc.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7726src" href="#xd26e7726" name=
"xd26e7726src">39</a></p>
<p>On January 2, 1899, Aguinaldo announced the formation of a new
cabinet made up as follows: Apolinario Mabini president and secretary
of foreign affairs; Teodoro Sandico, secretary of the interior; Mariano
Trias, secretary of the treasury; Baldomero Aguinaldo, secretary of war
and navy, and Gracio Gonzaga, secretary of <i lang=
"es">fomento</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7739src" href="#xd26e7739"
name="xd26e7739src">40</a> On January 4 Mabini took the oath of office
as the president <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267"
name="pb267">267</a>]</span>of the council of government. This body met
twice a week at Malolos on set days, and at the close of its
deliberations forwarded to Aguinaldo a statement of the subjects
discussed and the conclusions reached for his decision. The president
of the republic did not preside at, or take part in, its
deliberations.</p>
<p>On January 4, 1899, General Otis issued a proclamation in which he
announced that the United States had obtained possession of the
Philippines and that its government would be extended over the islands
of the archipelago. Aguinaldo replied next day with one which, if not
intended to be a declaration of war, was at least a warning that
hostilities were imminent. This proclamation was carried into Manila by
his emissaries and posted up over the one issued by the American
commander. It was a challenge to a trial of strength, and Aguinaldo and
his advisers hastened their preparations for the coming combat.</p>
<p>The secretary of the interior on the same day sent an order to the
heads of all provinces directing the organization of territorial
militia to resist the American invasion, and ordering the heads of the
towns to hold meetings of the people to protest against the aggression
of the United States. They were held in accordance with these orders,
and records of the proceedings were sent to Malolos and published in
the official organ of the government as evidence of the feeling of the
people. It was, however, not considered necessary in publishing them to
mention the fact that they had been held in compliance with orders.</p>
<p>On January 14, 1899, Mabini wrote to Aguinaldo<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7751src" href="#xd26e7751" name="xd26e7751src">41</a>
recommending changes in the proposed constitution, which he still liked
as little as ever. He was afraid that Negros and Panay would refuse to
accept the form of government it prescribed. The worst thing about it
was that the Americans would be less disposed to recognize
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government; for when they saw the constitution they
would know, as it made no mention of them, that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>Filipinos wanted independence. Mabini thought
that it was possible that the wording of the constitution might have
been deliberately planned by members of the congress in favour of
annexation to the United States, so that that country would be warned,
would become more mistrustful, and would refuse to recognize
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government. Whatever the president of the council may
have thought about the theoretical advisability of a congress to
represent the people, he found one much in the way when he had obtained
it.</p>
<p>Buencamino advised that the constitution should be approved and
promulgated; one argument was that the congress had been consulted in
the matter of a national loan, and if it was dissolved, there could be
no loan. This was apparently the only matter upon which it had been
consulted.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7758src" href="#xd26e7758" name=
"xd26e7758src">42</a></p>
<p>The constitution of the Philippine Republic was ratified at a
session of the congress on January 20, 1899.</p>
<p>On January 21, 1899, Aguinaldo sanctioned it and ordered that it
should be &ldquo;kept, complied with and executed in all its parts
because it is the sovereign will of the Philippine
people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7765src" href="#xd26e7765"
name="xd26e7765src">43</a> The constitution provided for a government
of three co&ouml;rdinate powers, executive, legislative and judicial.
Whether it provided for a form of government which would have succeeded
in the Philippines was not determined by actual experience. It was
never really put in force for war with the United States began in two
weeks and the constitution must stand as the expression of the ideas of
a certain group of educated natives rather than as the working formula
for the actual conduct of the political life of a nation. One proof of
this is the fact that not until June 8, 1899, were Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
decrees upon the registration of marriages and upon civil marriage,
dated June 20,1898, revoked, and the provisions of the constitution
concerning marriage put in effect.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7768src"
href="#xd26e7768" name="xd26e7768src">44</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>Aguinaldo had approved the constitution; he had informed the foreign
consuls and General Otis that it had been promulgated and become the
law of the land. It was not promulgated. It had not become the law of
the land. It served one important purpose. It passed into the hands of
the Americans and showed them the ability and the aspirations of
certain individuals of the archipelago, but Mabini and his followers
did not believe in its form or in its provisions, and Mabini at least
was emphatic in his declarations that the time had not yet come for it
to be put into effect. On January 24, 1899, he wrote to Aguinaldo that
if it should be promulgated it would be absolutely necessary to give
the president the veto power, and replace the elected representatives
by others appointed by the government. If this were not done the
president would be at the mercy of congress, and the people, seeing
that disagreement between the executive government and the congress was
the cause of its misfortunes, would start another revolutionary
movement to destroy both of them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7774src"
href="#xd26e7774" name="xd26e7774src">45</a></p>
<p>As long as Mabini remained in power the constitution was mere paper.
Its adoption was not indicative of the capacity of the people to
maintain self-government. It expressed only the academic aspirations of
the men who drafted it. There is not the slightest evidence from any
previous or subsequent experience of the people that it would have
worked in practice. It was enacted for the misleading of Americans
rather than for the benefit of the Filipinos.</p>
<p>While the government of Aguinaldo was called a republic, it was in
fact a Tag&aacute;log military oligarchy in which the great mass of the
people had no share. Their duty was only to give soldiers for the army
and labourers for the fields, and to obey without question the orders
they received from the military heads of their provinces.</p>
<p>There is no cause for vain regrets. We did not destroy a republic in
the Philippines. There never was anything there to destroy which even
remotely resembled a republic. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270"

&ldquo;Here was a man claiming to be President of a newly established
republic based on the principles set forth in our Declaration of
Independence, which republic had just issued a like Declaration, and he
was invited to come and hear our declaration read, and declined because
we would not recognize his right to assert the same

&ldquo;The war satisfied us all that Aguinaldo would have been a small
edition of Porfirio Diaz, and that the Filipino
republic-that-might-have-been would have been, very decidedly, &lsquo;a
going concern,&rsquo; although Aguinaldo probably would have been able
to say with a degree of accuracy, as Diaz might have said in Mexico for
so many years, &lsquo;The Republic? I am the
Republic.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;&mdash;Blount, p. 292.&nbsp;<a class=

&ldquo;The war demonstrated to the army, to a Q. E. D., that the
Filipinos are &lsquo;capable of self-government,&rsquo; unless the kind
which happens to suit the genius of the American people is the only
kind of government on earth that is respectable, and the one panacea
for all the ills of government among men without regard to their
temperament or historical antecedents. The educated patriotic Filipinos
can control the masses of the people in their several districts as
completely as a captain ever controlled a company.&rdquo;&mdash;Blount,

&ldquo;Even to-day the presidente of a pueblo is as absolute boss of
his town as Charles F. Murphy is in Tammany Hall. And a town or pueblo
in the Philippines is more than an area covered by more or less
contiguous buildings and grounds. It is more like a township in
Massachusetts, so that when you account governmentally for the pueblos
of a given province, you account for every square foot of that province
and for every man in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&ldquo;In there reviewing the Samar and other insurrections of 1905 in
the Philippines, you find him (<i>i.e.</i> Roosevelt) dealing with the
real root of the evil with perfect honesty, though adopting the view
that the Filipino people were to blame therefor, because we had placed
too much power in the hands of an ignorant electorate, which had
elected rascally officials.&rdquo;&mdash;Blount, p. 297.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Also:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;But we proceeded to ram down their
throats a preconceived theory that the only road to self-government was
for an alien people to step in and make the ignorant masses the <i>sine

<p class="footnote cont">Also:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Of course the ignorant elecorate we
perpetrated on Samar as an &lsquo;expression of our theoretical
views&rsquo; proved that we had &lsquo;gone too fast&rsquo; in
conferring self-government, or to quote Mr. Roosevelt, had been
&lsquo;reposing too much confidence in the self-governing power of a
people,&rsquo; if to begin with the rankest material for constructing a
government that there was at hand was to offer a fair test of capacity
for self-government.&rdquo;&mdash;Blount, p. 546.&nbsp;<a class=

7, 1898, the secretary of the revolutionary junta in Mindanao, in
writing to Aguinaldo, closed his letter with the following formula:
&ldquo;Command this, your vassal, at all hours at the orders of his
respected chief, on whom he will never turn his back, and whom he will
never forswear. God preserve you, Captain General, many years.&rdquo;
P.I.R., 1080. 1. Every now and then we find a queer use of the term
&ldquo;royal family.&rdquo; This seems to have been common among the
mass of the people. Heads of towns and men of position often used the
expression &ldquo;royal orders&rdquo; in speaking of the orders and
decrees issued by Aguinaldo. For example, the officials of Tayug, a
town of 19,000 people in Pangasin&aacute;n Province, certified, on
October 9, 1898, that they had carried out the instructions for
&ldquo;the establishment of the popular government in accordance with
the royal decree of June 18, 1898.&rdquo;&mdash;P.I.R., 1188. 1.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In October certain of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
adherents in Tondo wrote to him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250n"
href="#pb250n" name="pb250n">250</a>]</span>and protested against the
acts of the local presidente, who, they held, had not been duly elected
in accordance with the provisions of the &ldquo;royal order&rdquo; of
June 18, 1898. They closed their respectful protest by requesting that
said royal order should be obeyed.&mdash;Taylor, AJ., 63.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In 1899 an officer of the army in Union
Province wrote: &ldquo;In accordance with the orders of the secretary
of war of our republican government of these islands, issued in
compliance with royal decree, article 5, published on March 8.&rdquo;
On September 1, 1898, the local presidente of the town of Mangatarem,
writing to the head of the province, said that he had not furnished the
estimates required because the elections provided for in &ldquo;article
7 of the royal decree of the superior government, dated June 18
last,&rdquo; had not been approved. A young son of a member of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s cabinet, writing to his father in September, 1899,
spoke of the &ldquo;royal decree of June 18, 1898.&rdquo;&mdash;P.I.R.,
1188. 3. In Romblon, in August, 1898, elections were held in compliance
with the prescription of the &ldquo;royal decree of June 18,
1898,&rdquo; and Aguinaldo approved them, apparently without
considering that this was an anomalous way of describing a decree of
the dictator of the so-called republic. On March 7, 1899, a general in
the revolutionary service stated that an officer had been released from
arrest by a &ldquo;royal order.&rdquo; The attitude of mind which made
men speak of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s &ldquo;royal orders&rdquo; in 1898 did
not change when he fled before the advance of the United States army.
His orders remained royal orders. They were again and again referred to
in this way.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">The Conduct of the War</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is not my intention to attempt to write a history
of the war which began on February 4, 1899, nor to discuss any one of
its several campaigns. I propose to limit myself to a statement of the
conditions under which it was conducted, and a description of the two
periods into which it may be divided.</p>
<p>From the outset the Insurgent soldiers were treated with marked
severity by their leaders. On June 17, 1898, Aguinaldo issued an order
to the military chiefs of certain towns in Cavite providing that a
soldier wasting ammunition should be punished with twelve lashes for a
first offence, twenty-four for a second, and court-martialled and
&ldquo;severely punished&rdquo; for a third.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7793src" href="#xd26e7793" name="xd26e7793src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>On November 16, 1900, General Lacuna ordered that any officer
allowing his soldiers to load their rifles when not before the enemy
should be liable to capital punishment,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7840src" href="#xd26e7840" name="xd26e7840src">2</a> which in
practice was frequently inflicted on soldiers for very minor
offences.</p>
<p>Men of means were drafted into the ranks and then excused from
service on the payment of cash.</p>
<p>The soldiery, quartered on the towns, committed endless abuses.
Conditions were bad enough before the outbreak of hostilities, as I
have shown in the chapters dealing with Insurgent rule. They grew
rapidly worse thereafter, and human life became cheap indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The documents of this period show that the insurgent troops
driven from the front of Manila fell upon the people of the
neighbouring towns and burnt, robbed, and murdered. Either their
officers lost all control over them, or else they directed these
outrages. It was not for some days that control was
regained.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7873src" href="#xd26e7873"
name="xd26e7873src">3</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=

<p>Endless orders were issued by Aguinaldo and other high Insurgent
officers, prohibiting rape, brigandage and robbery, and there was grave
need of them. Unfortunately they could not be enforced. Indeed it was
often impossible to distinguish between Insurgent soldiers, who removed
their uniforms or had none, and brigands pure and simple.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7884src" href="#xd26e7884" name=
"xd26e7884src">4</a></p>
<p>Many men were soldiers at one time and brigands at another.
Unquestionably soldiers and brigands sometimes co&ouml;perated.
Garrisons were withdrawn from towns which did not promptly and fully
comply with the demands of Insurgent commanders,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7925src" href="#xd26e7925" name="xd26e7925src">5</a> and armed
bandits appeared and plundered them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>There were some Insurgent leaders, like Cailles, who suppressed
brigandage with a heavy hand,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7939src" href=
"#xd26e7939" name="xd26e7939src">6</a> but many of them were
indifferent, even if not in alliance with the evil doers.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Visayas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Feeling between Tag&aacute;log soldiers and Visayan
people grew constantly more bitter, and before many months had passed
they fell to killing each other. The highest officers of the
&ldquo;Regional Revolutionary Government of the Visayas&rdquo;
protested vigorously to Aguinaldo,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7970src"
href="#xd26e7970" name="xd26e7970src">7</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>but
without result. The situation was entirely beyond his control.</p>
<p>On April 20, 1899, General Delgado issued an order which tells a
significant story of conditions, and of his own weakness in dealing
with them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8042src" href="#xd26e8042" name=
"xd26e8042src">8</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Luz&oacute;n General Trias of Cavite accused the soldiers and
citizens of his province of committing &ldquo;robberies, assaults,
kidnappings and crimes which are committed only by barbarous and savage
tribes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8075src" href="#xd26e8075"
name="xd26e8075src">9</a></p>
<p>That very serious conditions promptly became general is conclusively
shown by the record of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government for February 24,
1899, when it decided&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;that the president of the council shall study
such measures as will put an end to the continual discord and friction
between the civil and military authorities of every province, in order
that fatal consequences may be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>With such conditions prevailing among the Filipinos themselves, it
was to be expected that the laws of civilized warfare would be violated
and that American soldiers taken prisoners would sometimes be treated
with barbarity. Flags of truce were deliberately violated.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8109src" href="#xd26e8109" name=
"xd26e8109src">10</a> American soldiers were trapped, poisoned<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8115src" href="#xd26e8115" name=
"xd26e8115src">11</a> and murdered in other ways.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8124src" href="#xd26e8124" name="xd26e8124src">12</a></p>
<p>It was promptly charged in the United States that American soldiers
were committing barbarities, and Blount has revived these old
tales.</p>
<p>I know personally that during the early days of the war Insurgent
prisoners and wounded were treated with the greatest humanity and
kindness.</p>
<p>A part of the Insurgent plan of campaign was the circulation of the
most shocking statements concerning the abuses committed by American
soldiers. I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"
name="pb277">277</a>]</span>elsewhere described<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8135src" href="#xd26e8135" name="xd26e8135src">13</a> the fate
that overtook Colonel Arguelles, in part because he told the truth as
to the humane treatment by the Americans of prisoners and wounded.</p>
<p>Not only did some of those who did this forfeit their lives, but
newspaper articles, military orders, and proclamations issued by civil
officers informed the people that the American soldiers stole, burned,
robbed, raped and murdered. Especial stress was laid on their alleged
wholesale violations of women, partly to turn the powerful influence of
the women as a whole against them, and partly to show that they were no
better than the Insurgents themselves, who frequently committed
rape.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8143src" href="#xd26e8143" name=
"xd26e8143src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>These horrible tales were at first believed even by some of the
responsible Insurgent officers in remote regions,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8188src" href="#xd26e8188" name="xd26e8188src">15</a> but all
such men soon learned the truth, which was known to most of them from
the start.</p>
<p>In official correspondence between them, not intended for the
public, orders were given to use women as bearers of despatches for the
reason that Americans did not search them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8197src" href="#xd26e8197" name="xd26e8197src">16</a> More
significant yet, when conditions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>became bad in the provinces,
Insurgent officers sent their women and children to seek American
protection in Manila or elsewhere. Cartload after cartload of them came
in at Angeles, shortly after General Jacob H. Smith took that place.
Aguinaldo himself followed this procedure, as is shown by the following
extracts from Villa&rsquo;s famous diary:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8207src" href="#xd26e8207" name="xd26e8207src">17</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>December 22.</i>&mdash;It was 7 A.M. when we
arrived in Ambayuan. Here we found the women worn out from the painful
journey they had suffered. They were seated on the ground. In their
faces were observed indications of the ravages of hunger; but they are
always smiling, saying they would prefer suffering in these mountains
to being under the dominion of the Americans, and that such sacrifices
are the duties of every patriot who loves his country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We secured some camotes in this settlement, cooked them
immediately, and everybody had breakfast. Our appetites were
satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honorable president had already decided some days before
to send all the women to Manila, including his family, and this was his
motive in hurrying his family forward with him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;<i>December 24.</i>&mdash;We find ourselves still in Talubin.
About 8 o&rsquo;clock this morning a report came saying the Americans
had arrived at Bontoc, the provincial capital, the nearest town to
Talubin, and distant from it two hours by the road. An immediate
decision was made. The honourable president told his family and the
other women that they should remain in the settlement and allow
themselves to be caught by the Americans, and he named Se&ntilde;ors
Sytiar and Paez to remain also, with the obligation of conducting the
women to Manila. As soon as the arrangement was effected, the
honourable president prepared himself for the march. The parting was a
very sad one for himself and for his family. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>&ldquo;The honourable president left Talubin at
11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, his family and the other women
remaining behind with two gentlemen charged with conducting them to
Manila.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8229src" href="#xd26e8229"
name="xd26e8229src">18</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="figureHead">A Scene in the Baguio Teachers&rsquo; Camp</p>
<p class="first">The houses are for visiting lecturers and persons of
similar rank. The tents are for the teachers.</p>
</div>
<p>In this, as in all other similar cases, the women were kindly
treated and safely conducted to their destination. Aguinaldo and his
fellows knew the happy fate of the members of his own family, as is
shown by a later entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>February 6.</i>&mdash;We have been informed
that the mother and son of the honourable president are at Manila,
living in the house of Don Benito Legarda, and that they reached that
capital long before the wife and sister of the honourable president. We
have also learned that Se&ntilde;or Buencamino, and Tirona, and
Concepcion are prisoners of the American authorities in Manila. With
reference to the wife and sister of the honourable president and the
two Leyba sisters, it is said that they went to Vigan and from there
went by steamer to Manila.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8247src"
href="#xd26e8247" name="xd26e8247src">19</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mother and son, accompanied by Buencamino, had allowed
themselves to be captured at an earlier date. What shall we say of a
leader who would turn his mother, wife, sister and son over to American
soldiers for safekeeping, and then continue to denounce the latter as
murderers, and violaters of women? Aguinaldo did just this. That the
Insurgent leaders were early and fully aware of the treatment accorded
their wounded is shown by the following extract from a letter to
General Moxica of Leyte, dated March 2, 1900, giving instructions as to
what should be done with wounded men:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;If by chance any of our men are wounded on the
field or elsewhere, efforts must be made to take away the rifles and
ammunition at once and carry them away as far as possible, so that they
may not be captured by the enemy; and if the wounded cannot be
immediately removed elsewhere or retreat from the place, let them be
left there, because it is better to save the arms than the men, as
there are many Filipinos to fill up the ranks, but rifles are scarce
and difficult to secure for battle; and besides the Americans, coming
upon any wounded, take good care of them, while the rifles are
destroyed; therefore, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>I repeat, they must endeavour to
save the arms rather than the men.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8258src" href="#xd26e8258" name="xd26e8258src">20</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were some rare individual instances in which uninjured
Filipinos were treated with severity, and even with cruelty, by
American soldiers. They occurred for the most part late in the war when
the &ldquo;water cure&rdquo; in mild form was sometimes employed in
order to compel persons who had guilty knowledge of the whereabouts of
firearms to tell what they knew, to the end that the perpetration of
horrible barbarities on the common people, and the assassination of
those who had sought American protection, might the more promptly
cease. Usually the sufferers were themselves bloody murderers, who had
only to tell the truth to escape punishment. The men who performed
these cruel acts knew what treatment was being commonly accorded to
Filipinos, and in some instances to their own comrades. I mention these
facts to explain, not to excuse, their conduct. Cruel acts cannot be
excused, but those referred to seldom resulted in any permanent injury
to the men who suffered them, and were the rare and inevitable
exceptions to the general rule that the war was waged, so far as the
Americans were concerned, with a degree of humanity hitherto
unprecedented under similar conditions. The Insurgents violated every
rule of civilized warfare, yet oathbreakers, spies and men fighting in
citizens&rsquo; clothes not only were not shot by the Americans, as
they might very properly have been, but were often turned loose with a
mere warning not to offend again.</p>
<p>The false news circulated to aid the Insurgent cause was by no means
limited to such matters. Every time their troops made a stand they were
promptly defeated and driven back, but their faltering courage was
bolstered up by glorious tidings of wonderful, but wholly imaginary,
victories won elsewhere. It was often reported that many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>times more Americans had fallen in some
insignificant skirmish than were actually killed in the whole war,
while generals perished by the dozen and colonels by the thousand. Our
losses on March 27, 1899, in fighting north of Manila, were said to be
twenty-eight thousand. In reality only fifty-six Americans were killed
in all northern Luz&oacute;n during the entire month.</p>
<p>On April 26, 1899, the governor of Iloilo published the following
remarkable news items among others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Pavia</span>, April 6th,
1899.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Liberating Army of the Visayan Islands to the Local

<p>&ldquo;At 9.45 P.M. Commissioner Laguna details 6000 more Americans

<p>&ldquo;Otis requests parley, and our representatives being present,
he tells them to request peace and conditions, to which they replied
that he, and not they, should see to that, so the parley accomplished
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day, Wednesday, a decisive battle will be fought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the 5000 prisoners there are two generals. Tomorrow

"#xd26e8310" name="xd26e8310src">21</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Santa Ana is a suburb of Manila. The Rosario and Escolta are the
main business streets of the city.</p>
<p>Apparently the Insurgents must have thought that colonels were as
numerous in our army as in theirs, for they reported two thousand of
them killed on February 6, 1899, and threw in one general for good
measure.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8317src" href="#xd26e8317" name=
"xd26e8317src">22</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>We learn from the <i>Filipino Herald</i> for February 23, 1899, that
on that day the Filipino army captured and occupied the suburbs of
Manila, while American troops were besieged in the outskirts of the
city, at La Loma, and in the neighbouring town of Caloocan.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8352src" href="#xd26e8352" name=
"xd26e8352src">23</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span></p>
<p>But why continue. No tale concerning American losses in the
Philippines was too fantastic to be told by the leaders and believed by
the soldiery and the populace. The American soldiers were even said to
be refusing to fight, and great prisons were being constructed in order
properly to punish them.</p>
<p>General MacArthur and his entire staff were captured before March 2,
1900, according to a letter sent to General Moxica of Leyte on that
date.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8397src" href="#xd26e8397" name=
"xd26e8397src">24</a></p>
<p>And what of conditions in the United States during this troubled
period? We learn from the Insurgent records that prior to January 15,
1900, &ldquo;the Union Army&rdquo; had met with a new disaster, as a
result of which President McKinley tendered his resignation, being
succeeded by Mr. Bryan. Philippine independence was to be proclaimed on
February 4, 1899. On January 20, &ldquo;General Otis&rsquo;s successor,
John Waterly, of the democratic party,&rdquo; arrived at Manila with
papers and instructions relative to proclaiming the Philippine
Republic.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8402src" href="#xd26e8402" name=
"xd26e8402src">25</a> Things now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>went from bad to worse. The
trouble between democrats and republicans resulted in an insurrection.
Before August, 1901, President McKinley had brought about strained

<p>The first period of the war, which we may term the period of
organized armed resistance, drew rapidly to its close, and there
followed the second period, characterized by guerrilla tactics on the
part of the Insurgents.</p>
<p>On September 14, 1899, Aguinaldo accepted the advice of General
P&iacute;o del Pilar, ex-bandit, if indeed he had ever ceased to rob
and murder, and authorized this man, whom he had been again and again
asked to remove, to begin guerrilla warfare in Bulacan. Guerrilla
tactics were duly authorized for, and had been adopted by, Insurgent
forces everywhere before the end of November.</p>
<p>Of this style of fighting Taylor has truly said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;If war in certain of its aspects is a temporary
reversion to barbarism, guerrilla warfare is a temporary reversion to
savagery. The man who orders it assumes a grave responsibility before
the people whose fate is in his hands, for serious as is the material
destruction which this method of warfare entails, the destruction to
the orderly habits of mind and thought which, at bottom, are
civilization, is even more serious. Robbery and brigandage, murder and
arson follow in its wake. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>Guerrilla warfare means a policy of destruction, a policy of terror,
and never yet, however great may have been the injury caused by it,
however much it may have prolonged the war in which it has been
employed, has it secured a termination favorable to the people who have
chosen it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8455src" href="#xd26e8455"
name="xd26e8455src">28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case under discussion furnished no exception to the general
rule.</p>
<div class="figure p038width" id="p038"><img src="images/p038.jpg" alt=

</div>
<p>Such semblance of discipline as had previously existed among the
Insurgent soldiers rapidly disappeared. Conditions had been very bad
under the &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; and worse during the first period of
the war. During the second period they rapidly became unendurable in
many regions, and the common people were driven into the arms of the
Americans, in spite of threats of death, barbarously carried out by
Insurgent officers, soldiers and agents in thousands of cases. I have
described at some length the conditions which now arose in the chapter
on Murder as a Governmental Agency, to which the reader is referred for
details.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8467src" href="#xd26e8467" name=
"xd26e8467src">29</a></p>
<p>In the effort to protect the towns which showed themselves friendly,
the American forces were divided, subdivided and subdivided again. On
March 1, 1901, they were occupying no less than five hundred two
stations. By December of the same year the number had increased to six
hundred thirty-nine, with an average of less than sixty men to a post.
As a result of the protection thus afforded and of the humane conduct
of our troops, the people turned to us in constantly increasing
numbers.</p>
<p>It remained to stamp out the dying embers of insurrection, while
continuing to seek to protect those who put their trust in us. Further
subdivision of the troops in order to garrison more points was hardly
possible, but field operations were actively pushed. One after another
the Insurgent leaders were captured or voluntarily surrendered. Most
officers of importance issued explanatory statements to the people
shortly after giving up active field operations, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>whether they surrendered voluntarily or were
taken prisoners. Aguinaldo himself was captured on March 23, 1901, at
Palanan, the northernmost point on the east coast of Luzon inhabited by
civilized people. No place in the islands, inhabited by Filipinos, is
more completely isolated, and he had long been almost entirely cut off
from his followers, many of whom believed him to be dead. On April 19,
1901, he issued an address to the Filipino people, in which he clearly
recognized the fact that they wanted peace. He said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Manila</span>, April 19,
1901.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Filipino People:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that I am not in error in presuming that the
unhappy fate to which my adverse fortune has led me is not a surprise
to those who have been familiar day by day with the progress of the
war. The lessons thus taught, the full meaning of which has recently
come to my knowledge, suggested to me with irresistible force that the
complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only
desirable but absolutely essential to the welfare of the
Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Filipinos have never been dismayed by their weakness, nor
have they faltered in following the path pointed out by their fortitude
and courage. The time has come, however, in which they find their
advance along the path impeded by an irresistible force&mdash;a force
which, while it restrains them, yet enlightens the mind and opens
another course by presenting to them the cause of peace. This cause has
been joyfully embraced by a majority of our fellow-countrymen, who have
already united around the glorious and sovereign banner of the United
States. In this banner they repose their trust in the belief that under
its protection our people will attain all the promised liberties which
they are even now beginning to enjoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country has declared unmistakably in favor of peace; so
be it. Enough of blood; enough of tears and desolation. This wish
cannot be ignored by the men still in arms if they are animated by no
other desire than to serve this noble people which has thus clearly
manifested its will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So also do I respect this will now that it is known to me,
and after mature deliberation resolutely proclaim to the world that I
cannot refuse to heed the voice of a people longing for peace, nor the
lamentations of thousands of families yearning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>to
see their dear ones in the enjoyment of the liberty promised by the
generosity of the great American nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United
States throughout the entire Archipelago, as I now do without any
reservation whatsoever, I believe that I am serving thee, my beloved
country. May happiness be theirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Emilio Aguinaldo</span>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8504src" href="#xd26e8504" name="xd26e8504src">30</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Manila</span>, April 19, 1901.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This announcement of Aguinaldo, published in Spanish, Tag&aacute;log
and English, undoubtedly hastened the end of the war, but it did not
lead to immediate general surrender, for as Taylor has very truly
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A force like Aguinaldo&rsquo;s could not be
surrendered. It had been torn by internal dissensions and the bonds of
discipline had always been very lax. It had originally been held
together by a lively expectation of the advantages to be obtained from
the pillage of Manila. That hope had disappeared, and the leaders had
become the lords of life and property each in his own province. It was
a force which could disintegrate, but which could not surrender. Only
armies can do that. Forces over which their leaders have lost all
except nominal control when beaten do not surrender. They disintegrate
by passing through the stages of guerrilla warfare, of armed bands of
highwaymen, of prowling groups of thieves, of sturdy beggars who at
opportune moments resort to petty larceny.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8518src" href="#xd26e8518" name="xd26e8518src">31</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s forces now passed through these several stages.
Some of his more important subordinates had previously been captured or
had surrendered. Others, still remaining in the field, now acted on his
advice, more or less promptly. A few remained obdurate for a time, but
as a rule not for long, and soon there remained in the field only a
very limited number of real military leaders, like General Malvar in
Batangas and General Lukban in Samar, and a very considerable number of
bandit chiefs, some of whom had posed as Insurgents. The forces of the
latter were now materially and rapidly augmented by men who had been
Insurgent officers or soldiers and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"
href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>while serving in this
capacity had become so enamoured of a lawless life that they were now
unwilling to settle down and work for their daily bread, preferring to
continue to live off their long-suffering fellow-countrymen, whom they
robbed and murdered more mercilessly than ever.</p>
<p>The war was practically over. The insurrection had failed. In my
opinion no Filipino who held out to the end for independence compared
in intellectual power with Mabini, and I deem his views as to why it
failed worthy of special attention. At the time of his death, he left
behind a memoir from which I quote the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The revolution failed because it was poorly
led, because its head conquered his place, not by meritorious, but by
reprehensible actions, because in place of supporting the men most
useful to the people, he rendered them useless because he was jealous
of them. Believing that the aggrandizement of the people was nothing
more than his own personal aggrandizement, he did not judge the merits
of men by their capacity, character, or patriotism, but by the degree
of friendship and relationship which bound them to him; and wishing to
have his favorites always ready to sacrifice themselves for him, he
showed himself complaisant to their faults. Having thus secured the
people, the people deserted him. And the people having deserted him, he
had to fall like a wax idol melted by the heat of adversity. God forbid
that we should forget so terrible a lesson learned at the cost of
unspeakable sufferings.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8531src"
href="#xd26e8531" name="xd26e8531src">32</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are by no means the only reasons why the revolution failed,
but they foredoomed it to failure.</p>
<p>The surrender or capture of the more respectable military element
left the unsurrendered firearms in the hands of men most of whom were
ignorant, many of whom were criminal, and nearly all of whom were
irresponsible and unscrupulous.</p>
<p>Strict enforcement of the rules of civilized warfare against them
was threatened, but not actually resorted to. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>The situation was particularly bad in Batangas. General J. F. Bell
was put in charge there, and he found a humane and satisfactory
solution of the existing difficulties in reconcentration&mdash;not the
kind of reconcentration which made the Spaniards hated in Cuba, but a
measure of a wholly different sort. This measure and its results have
been concisely described by Taylor, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;General Bell said he was as anxious as any one
could be to avoid making war against those who really wanted the
termination of hostilities, and it was his duty to protect them against
the vengeance of others. Over and above all these considerations in
importance, however, was the absolute necessity of making it impossible
for insurgents to procure food by levying contributions. Therefore, in
order to give those who were pacifically inclined an opportunity to
escape hardship, as far as possible, and preserve their food supply for
themselves and their families, it was determined to establish zones of
protection with limits sufficiently near all towns to enable the small
garrisons thereof to give the people living within these zones
efficient protection against ruinous exactions by insurgents. He
accordingly, &lsquo;in order to put an end to enforced contributions
now levied by insurgents upon the inhabitants of sparsely settled and
outlying barrios and districts by means of intimidation and
assassination,&rsquo; ordered the commanding officers of all towns in
the provinces of Batangas and Laguna to &lsquo;immediately specify and
establish plainly marked limits surrounding each town bounding a zone
within which it may be practicable, with an average-sized garrison, to
exercise sufficient supervision over and furnish protection to
inhabitants (who desire to be peaceful) against the depredation of
armed insurgents. The limits may include the barrios which exist
sufficiently near the town to be given protection and supervision by
the garrison, and should include some ground on which live stock could
graze, but so situated that it can be patrolled and watched. All
ungarrisoned towns will be garrisoned as soon as troops become
available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Commanding officers will also see that orders
are at once given and distributed to all the inhabitants within the
jurisdiction of towns over which they exercise supervision, informing
them of the danger of remaining outside of these limits, and that
unless they move by December 25 from outlying barrios and districts,
with all their movable food supplies, including <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>rice, <i>palay</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8553src" href="#xd26e8553" name="xd26e8553src">33</a> chickens,
live stock, etc., to within the limits of the zone established at their
own or nearest town, their property (found outside of said zone at said
date) will become liable to confiscation or destruction. The people
will be permitted to move houses from outlying districts should they
desire to do so, or to construct temporary shelter for themselves on
any vacant land without compensation to the owner, and no owner will be
permitted to deprive them of the privilege of doing so. In the
discretion of commanding officers the prices of necessities of
existence may also be regulated in the interest of those thus seeking
protection. As soon as peaceful conditions have been re&euml;stablished
in the brigade these persons will be encouraged to return to their
homes, and such assistance be rendered them as may be found
practicable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was deemed best not to compel the people to enter these
zones; but they were warned that unless they accepted that protection
their property, which consisted almost entirely of food supplies, would
become liable to confiscation or destruction, because it might be
impossible to determine whether it belonged to hostile or peaceful
people. To put an end to vengeance by assassination, it was determined
to make use of the right of retaliation conferred by General Order 100
issued by President Lincoln in 1863. A circular telegram was published
announcing an intention to retaliate by the execution of prisoners of
war in case any more were assassinated by insurgents for political
reasons. It was not found necessary to do this. Assassinations stopped
at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the campaign progressed it became more and more apparent
that a large number of poor people had contributed through fear, for
the power of the insurgents to collect came to an end after they had
lost their power of intimidation. The efficiency of the protection
afforded in such zones was the determining factor in forming the
decision and attitude of many of the natives. The protection afforded
was efficient, and from time to time many additional families entered
the zones. The sentiment for peace grew stronger steadily and natives
volunteered assistance to Americans at every hand and in every town.
When these volunteers were trustworthy they were armed and sent out
into the mountains from which they brought back guns, and insurgents,
and hundreds of half-famished men, women, and children who, released
from the intimidating influence of the insurgents, entered the zones of
protection. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The most serious discomfort experienced by any one within
these areas was caused to the <i>mestizo</i> ruling group, whose
members bitterly resented the blow to their prestige in being treated
like every one else. They had been accustomed to have others work for
them and obey them blindly. To a man who could speak Spanish and who
had always been the lord of his <i>barrio</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8569src" href="#xd26e8569" name="xd26e8569src">34</a> the
possibility of having to cultivate a field with his own hands was an
unthinkable and scandalous thing. These men suffered and suffered
acutely; but it was not their bodies which suffered&mdash;it was their
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malvar surrendered on April 16, 1902. Most of the people had
turned against their once highly respected chief, and toward the end
several thousand natives of Batangas joined the Americans in their
determined hunt for the fugitive leader. Realization of the fact that
the people were against him materially aided in forcing his
surrender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Bell had captured or forced to surrender some 8000 to
10,000 persons actively engaged, in one capacity or another, in the
insurrection. These prisoners were rapidly released when they had taken
the oath of allegiance. By the first week of July no political
prisoners were held in this region. They had returned to their
homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The policy of concentrating the people in protected zones and
destroying the food which was used for the maintenance of guerrilla
bands was not new. There had been precedents even in the United States.
One of these is the order issued on August 25, 1863, by
Brigadier-General Ewing, commanding the district of the border, with
headquarters at Kansas City, Mo., in which he ordered the inhabitants
of a large part of three counties of that State to remove from their
residences within fifteen days to the protection of the military
stations which he had established. All grain and hay in that district
was ordered to be taken to those military stations. If it was not
convenient to so dispose of it, it would be burned (Rebellion Records,
Series I, Vol. XXII, Part II, p. 473). The American commanders in the
Philippines had adopted no new method of procedure in dealing with war
traitors; they had, however, effectively employed an old one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The insurrection had originated among the Tag&aacute;logs and
had spread like a conflagration from the territory occupied by them.
The fire had been quenched everywhere else. General Bell had now
stamped out the embers in the Tag&aacute;log provinces. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;On July 2 the Secretary of War telegraphed that the
insurrection against the sovereign authority of the United States in
the Philippines having come to an end, and provincial civil governments
having been established throughout the entire territory of the
archipelago not inhabited by Moro tribes, the office of military
governor in the archipelago was terminated. On July 4, 1902, the
President of the United States issued a proclamation of amnesty
proclaiming, with certain reservations, a full and complete pardon and
amnesty to all persons in the Philippine Archipelago who had
participated in the insurrection.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Bell&rsquo;s motives and methods in reconcentrating the
inhabitants of this troubled region have been grossly misrepresented,
and he himself has been sadly maligned. He is the most humane of men,
and the plan which he adopted resulted in the re&euml;stablishment of
law and order at a minimum cost of human suffering.</p>
<p>Many of the occupants of his reconcentration camps received there
their first lessons in hygienic living. Many of them were reluctant to
leave the camps and return to their homes when normal conditions again
prevailed.</p>
<p>The number of Filipinos killed during the Batangas campaign was very
small.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8590src" href="#xd26e8590" name=
"xd26e8590src">35</a> Blount has sought to make it appear that partly
as an indirect consequence of war there was dreadful mortality there,
citing by way of proof the fact that the Coast and Geodetic Atlas,
published as a part of the report of the first Philippine Commission,
gave the population of Batangas as 312,192, while the census of 1903
gave it as 257,715.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8593src" href=
"#xd26e8593" name="xd26e8593src">36</a></p>
<p>The report of the United States Philippine Commission for 1903 gives
the population of Manila as 221,000, while in 1900 it had been 260,000.
Does this mean that there had been a holocaust in Manila? Not at all.
It means <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>only that the thousands of Filipinos who had
sought the protection of the American forces there during the period
when they feared their own soldiers in the provinces had mostly
returned to their homes. During the disturbed period in Batangas great
numbers of people took refuge in other and more peaceful regions. Some
of them returned later; others did not.</p>
<p>Blount further quotes a statement in the 1901 report of the
Provincial Secretary of Batangas to the effect that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The mortality, caused no longer by the war, but
by disease, such as malaria and dysentery, has reduced to a little over
200,000 the more than 300,000 inhabitants which in former years the
province had.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8605src" href=
"#xd26e8605" name="xd26e8605src">37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the fact that these figures, showing a mortality of a
hundred thousand from disease alone, are hardly consistent with those
quoted by Blount as showing a decrease in population during a longer
period of only fifty-four thousand four hundred and forty-seven, it is
not apparent why Americans should be charged with deaths due to malaria
or dysentery, since no systematic effort to rid Batangas of these ills
had ever previously been made, and the very thing which then prevented
the adoption of the measures subsequently so successfully put forth to
this end was the disorderly conduct of the people themselves. As a
simple matter of fact, however, there was no such dreadful mortality
from these diseases at this time. Malaria has never been especially bad
in this province, and even cholera, which swept it during the period in
question and is far more readily communicated than is dysentery, caused
only twenty-three hundred and ninety-nine known deaths.</p>
<p>In the end peace was established and prosperity followed in its
wake.</p>
<p>This result was brought about in part by the efficient activity of
the armed forces of the United States and in part by the efforts of the
first and second Philippine Commissions.<a class="noteref" id=

&ldquo;Such ammunition was not effective unless fired from very close
quarters, but even its possession made the guerrillas stronger than the
people of the country and undoubtedly had much to do with securing
their co&ouml;peration, not only as bolomen but also in the digging of
the pits which were placed in the trails and also set about the towns.
These were required to be constructed by the local authorities. In the
bottom was set a sharp spike of bamboo, sometimes poisoned; and the pit
was covered with leaves and soil upon a fragile framework; so that if a
man stood upon it he would fall through upon the spike. Bows were set
in the jungle with a string set across the trail so that any one
stumbling over it would discharge a sharp bamboo shaft with a poisoned
head. On September 18, 1900, Lukban congratulated the people of the
town of Katubig upon the efficient use they had made of arrows with the
heads dipped in &lsquo;dita,&rsquo; a native poison. (P.I.R., 502.

<h2 class="label">Chapter X</h2>
<h2 class="main">Mr. Bryan and Independence</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In order to bring home to some of my Democratic and
Anti-Imperialist friends the unreliable character of the testimony of
even the very high officers of the so-called Philippine Republic, I
here quote certain extracts from the Insurgent records, showing the
important part played, doubtless unwittingly, by Mr. William Jennings
Bryan in Philippine politics during the war. The first of these might
properly have been considered in the chapter entitled &ldquo;Was
Independence Promised?&rdquo; Others are instructive in that they show
the use made of false news in bolstering up the Insurgent cause, and
might with propriety have been included in the chapter on &ldquo;The
Conduct of the War.&rdquo; I have thought it best to keep them by
themselves. Further comment on them would seem to be superfluous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On May 1, 1900 (P.I.R., 516.6), I. de los
Santos wrote a long letter in Tag&aacute;log and cipher to Aguinaldo,
in which he reported upon the progress of what he would have probably
called the diplomatic campaign. If this letter is to be believed, the
agents in the United States of the junta had been able to form
relations which might be of great value to them. Santos said in
part:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Commissioners&#8202;&hellip; Se&ntilde;ores
Kant (G. Apacible) and Raff (Sixto L&oacute;pez) duly carried out your
last instructions given at T&aacute;rlac. Se&ntilde;or Del Pan, sailing
by way of Japan, about the middle of October, and Se&ntilde;or Caney
(G. Apacible), sailing by way of Europe about the 1st of November, met
in Toronto about the middle of February following. But before the
arrival of Kant, Raff had already come from Hayti (United States) and
was able to pry in upon our political friends and enemies. When they
met each other they continued the voyage incognito, as Raft had done
previously, making themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>known to a very few people;
but later on, and according to the instructions carried by Caney, they
made themselves known to a greater number of people, and have succeeded
in interviewing Bryan who happened to be in New York. Se&ntilde;or Raff
said that Bryan feared being present at a conference, lest he might be
called a traitor by members of his own party, and also by those of the
opposite or &ldquo;imperialist&rdquo; party, who are quite proud over
the victories they have gained against our people over there.
Nevertheless, Raff was able to be present and talk at some of the
anti-imperialist meetings, our political friends introducing him as a
friend from the committee (at Hongkong) and as an advocate of the
cessation of the war over there in order that our sacred rights may be
given consideration by them. And as Bryan could not personally take
part in the conference, he sent a most trusted person, his right-hand
man, Dr. Gardner. The results of the conference between Se&ntilde;or
Raff and Dr. Gardner, the latter acting in the name of Mr. Bryan, are
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;1st. That we may fight on, and Bryan will never
cease to defend our sacred rights. 2nd. That we must never mention
Bryan&rsquo;s name in our manifestos and proclamations, lest the
opposite party might say he is a traitor. 3rd. That we are in the
right; and hence he promised in the name of Bryan that if this
Se&ntilde;or Bryan is victorious in the presidential campaign, he will
recognize our independence without delay. Your honored self can easily
conclude from all the foregoing that Se&ntilde;or Del Pan, after the
receipt of these promises, concurred with him; and he returned to
inform Se&ntilde;or Apacible about the results of the conference. So
these two studied over the plan of the policy to be adopted and carried
out. I write you what their opinions are, viz.: 1st, that they will
reside there, pending the outcome of the presidential contest, aiding
the propaganda and enlivening it until November, the date set for the
desired thing. Owing to what Dr. Gardner said and promised in the name
of Bryan, some one ought to stay there in order that Bryan may be
approached, if he is elected, so he can sign the recognition of our
independence; and this should be done at once, lest in his excitement
over the victory he should forget his promise. 3rd. For carrying out
the two propositions just mentioned, they request 2000 pounds sterling,
that is $20,000 in silver, to be used for the propaganda, for paying
newspapers and for bribing senators&mdash;this last clause is somewhat
dangerous and impossible. And 4th, that the money must be sent
immediately, and that you should be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>informed not to
mention the name of Bryan in the manifestos and proclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In order to answer quickly and decisively that
proposition, and as I did not have the desired money here, I answered
as follows: &ldquo;Plan approved; for the sake of economy we have
decided that one of the two retire, but before doing so make
arrangements, establish communications with leaders of Bryan&rsquo;s
party, and he who remains should thus cultivate the relations; he who
is to retire will locate himself in Paris near Se&ntilde;or Katipalad
(Agoncillo) with whom he will secretly discuss political problems that
may arise. So he will watch for the opportune moment of Bryan&rsquo;s
election, in order to go immediately to Hayti and formally arrange the
contract with Bryan.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8645src" href=
"#xd26e8645" name="xd26e8645src">1</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;By the end of 1899, by the time guerrilla
warfare was well under way, by the time that any Filipino government,
unless an expression of the unfettered will of the nearest bandit who
can muster a dozen rifles may be called a government, had ceased to
exist, a strong opposition to the policy of the administration had
arisen in the United States and a demand for the recognition of the
independence of the Philippines. The junta in Hongkong were assured
that the Democratic party would come into power in the next elections
and that this would mean the success of the patriotic efforts of
Aguinaldo and his followers. The news was good and was forthwith spread
abroad in &ldquo;Extracts from our correspondence with America,&rdquo;
&ldquo;News from our foreign agents,&rdquo; &ldquo;News from
America,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Translations from the foreign
press&rdquo;&mdash;circulars and handbills printed on thin paper which
were smuggled into the Philippines and passed into the hands of the
guerrilla leaders who could read Spanish. They gathered their followers
about them and told them that a powerful party had arisen in America
which was going to give them all they had ever asked for. They had only
to fight on, for success was certain. In America the
&ldquo;Anti-imperialists&rdquo; were hanging the
&ldquo;Imperialists,&rdquo; and they should continue to harry the
American adherents among the natives of the Philippines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;There are a number of these publications among
the papers captured from the insurgents, and the adoption of this
method of propaganda seems to have been nearly coincident with
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s orders declaring guerrilla warfare. It does not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>seem likely that the matter contained in them
was supplied by a Filipino, for if it was he assumed a general
acquaintance among the people with American politics and American
methods which they were far from possessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In these publications the Filipinos were
assured that the Imperialists were kept in power only by the lavish
contributions of the &ldquo;truts,&rdquo; whatever they may have been;
but the people of the United States were growing weary of their
domination and were about to return to the true principles of
Washington and Jefferson. The illustrious Americans &ldquo;Crosvy
Stickney, and Vartridge&rdquo; were all laboring for the cause of
Philippine independence. Long lists of American cities were given in
which the illustrious orators Mr. Croshy and Mr. Schurts had addressed
applauding crowds upon the necessity of throttling the
&ldquo;truts&rdquo; because they opposed recognition of the rights of
the Filipinos. In August, 1900, &ldquo;News from our agents in
America&rdquo; informed its readers that&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;W. J. Bryan has stated in a
speech that his first act upon being elected President will be to
declare the independence of the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;On June 16, 1900, Gen. Riego de Dios, acting
head of the Hongkong junta, wrote to Gen. I. Torres (P.I.R., 530), the
guerrilla commander in Bulac&aacute;n Province, and assured him that a
little more endurance, a little more constancy, was all that was needed
to secure the attainment of their ends. According to their advices the
Democratic party would win in the approaching elections in the United
States, and&mdash;&ldquo;it is certain that Bryan is the incarnation of
our independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The number of men opposed to the policy of the
administration was said to be continually increasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The attitude of those who protect us cannot be
more manly and resolute: &ldquo;Continue the struggle until you conquer
or die.&rdquo; Mr. Beecher of the League in Cincinnati writes us:
&ldquo;I shall always be the champion of the cause of justice and of
truth,&rdquo; says Mr. Winslow of the Boston League. &ldquo;Not even
threats of imprisonment will make me cease in my undertaking,&rdquo;
Doctor Denziger assures us. &ldquo;I shall accept every risk and
responsibility,&rdquo; says Doctor Leverson. &ldquo;If it is necessary,
I shall go so far as to provoke a revolution in my own country,&rdquo;
repeats Mr. Udell. &ldquo;It is necessary to save the Republic and
democracy from the abyss of imperialism and save the worthy Filipinos
from oppression and extermination&rdquo; is cried by all, and the sound
of this cry is ever rising louder and
louder.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8666src" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">The First Philippine Commission</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have elsewhere mentioned the appointment of the
First Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>On January 18, 1899, its civilian members met at Washington and
received the President&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>We were to aid in &ldquo;the most humane, pacific and effective
extension of authority throughout these islands, and to secure, with
the least possible delay, the benefits of a wise and generous
protection of life and property to the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were directed to meet at the earliest possible day in the city of
Manila and to announce by a public proclamation our presence and the
mission intrusted to us, carefully setting forth that while the
established military government would be continued as long as necessity
might require, efforts would be made to alleviate the burden of
taxation, to establish industrial and commercial prosperity and to
provide for the safety of persons and property by such means as might
be found conducive to those ends.</p>
<p>We were to endeavour, without interfering with the military
authorities, to ascertain what amelioration in the condition of the
inhabitants and what improvements in public order were practicable, and
for this purpose were to study attentively the existing social and
political state of the several populations, particularly as regarded
the forms of local government, the administration of justice, the
collection of customs and other taxes, the means of transportation and
the need of public improvements, reporting through the Department of
State the results of our observations and reflections, and recommending
such executive action as might, from time to time, seem to us wise and
useful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span></p>
<p>We were authorized to recommend suitable persons for appointment to
offices, made necessary by personal changes in the existing civil
administration, from among the inhabitants who had previously
acknowledged their allegiance to the American government.</p>
<p>We were to &ldquo;ever use due respect for all the ideals, customs
and institutions of the tribes which compose the population,
emphasizing upon all occasions the just and beneficent intentions of
the United States,&rdquo; and were commissioned on account of our
&ldquo;knowledge, skill, and integrity as bearers of the good-will, the
protection and the richest blessings of a liberating rather than a
conquering nation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8734src" href=
"#xd26e8734" name="xd26e8734src">1</a></p>
<p>Nothing could be more false than Blount&rsquo;s insinuation that we
were sent out to help Otis run the war.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8739src" href="#xd26e8739" name="xd26e8739src">2</a> There was no
war when we started, and we were expressly enjoined from interfering
with the military government or its officers. We were sent to deliver a
message of good-will, to investigate, and to recommend, and there our
powers ended.</p>
<p>Mr. Schurman and I, with a small clerical force, sailed from
Vancouver, January 31, 1899. On our arrival at Yokohama we learned with
keen regret of the outbreak of hostilities at Manila.</p>
<p>Blount has incorrectly stated that President McKinley had sent the
commission out when the dogs of war were already let loose.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8750src" href="#xd26e8750" name="xd26e8750src">3</a>
The dogs of war had not been loosed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>when we started, and
one of the main purposes in sending us was to keep them in their
kennels if possible.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo has made the following statements in his
&ldquo;Rese&ntilde;a Ver&iacute;dica&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&hellip; We, the Filipinos, would have received
said commission, as honourable agents of the great America, with
demonstrations of true kindness and entire adhesion. The commissioners
would have toured over all our provinces, seeing and observing at close
range order and tranquillity, in the whole of our territory. They would
have seen the fields tilled and planted. They would have examined our
Constitution and public administration, in perfect peace, and they
would have experienced and enjoyed that ineffable charm of our Oriental
manner, a mixture of abandon and solicitude, of warmth and of
frigidity, of confidence and of suspiciousness, which makes our
relations with foreigners change into a thousand colours, agreeable to
the utmost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but this landscape suited neither General Otis nor the
Imperialists! For their criminal intention it was better that the
American commissioners should find war and desolation in the
Philippines, perceiving from the day of their arrival the fetid stench
emitted by the mingled corpses of Americans and Filipinos. For their
purposes it was better that that gentleman, Mr. Schurman, President of
the Commission, could not leave Manila, limiting himself to listen to
the few Filipinos, who, having yielded to the reasonings of gold, were
partisans of the Imperialists. It was better that the commission should
contemplate the Philippine problem through conflagrations, to the whiz
of bullets, on the transverse light of all the unchained passions, in
order that it might not form any exact or complete opinion of the
natural and proper limits of said problem. Ah! it was better, in short,
that the commission should leave defeated in not having secured peace,
and would blame me and the other Filipinos, when I and the whole
Filipino people anxiously desired that peace should have been secured
before rather than now, but an honourable and worthy peace for the
United States and for the Philippine Republic.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8762src" href="#xd26e8762" name="xd26e8762src">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements, made to deceive the public, make interesting
reading in the light of our present knowledge as to the purposes and
plans of Aguinaldo and his associates. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>On our arrival at Yokohama we were promptly informed by a secretary
from the United States Legation that no less a personage than Marquis
Ito had been in frequent communication with the Filipinos since 1894,
that they had been looking to him for advice and support, and that he
had interested himself in the present situation sufficiently to come to
the American minister and offer to go to the Philippines, not in any
sense as an agent of the United States, but as a private individual,
and to use his influence in our behalf. His contention was that the
then existing conditions resulted from misunderstandings.</p>
<p>He said that Americans did not understand Asiatics, but he was an
Asiatic himself and did understand the Filipinos, and thought that he
could settle the whole affair. The minister had cabled to Washington
for instructions. Naturally the offer was not accepted.</p>
<p>I was reminded, by this extraordinary incident, of a previous
occurrence. I spent the month of March, 1893, in Tokio when returning
from my second visit to the Philippines, and was kindly invited to
inspect the zo&ouml;logical work at the Imperial University. When I
visited the institution for that purpose, I was questioned very closely
on the islands, their people and their resources. The gentlemen who
interrogated me may have been connected with the university, but I
doubt it.</p>
<p>We reached Hongkong on February 22. Here I had an interview with Dr.
Apacible of the junta, while Mr. Schurman visited Canton. Apacible told
me that the Filipinos wanted an independent republic under an American
protectorate. Pressed for the details of their desires, he said that
&ldquo;the function of a protector is to protect.&rdquo; Further than
that he could not go. I tried to convince him of the hopelessness of
the course the Filipinos were then pursuing and of the kindly
intentions of my government, but felt that I made no impression on
him.</p>
<p>We arrived at Manila on March 4, 1899, too late to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>land. Firebugs were abroad. We watched a number
of houses burn, and heard the occasional crackle of rifle fire along
the line of the defences around the city. The next morning there was
artillery fire for a time at San Pedro Mac&aacute;ti. Everywhere were
abundant evidences that the war was on.</p>
<p>This left little for us to do at the moment except to inform
ourselves as to conditions, especially as Colonel Denby had not yet
arrived, and General Otis was overwhelmed with work and anxiety.</p>
<p>I renewed my acquaintance with many old Filipino and Spanish friends
and improved the opportunity, not likely to recur in my experience, to
see as much as possible of the fighting in the field.</p>
<p>One day when I was at San Pedro Mac&aacute;ti, Captain Dyer, who
commanded a battery of 3.2-inch guns there, suggested that if I wished
to investigate the effect of shrapnel fire I could do so by visiting a
place on a neighbouring hillside which he indicated. Acting upon his
suggestion, I set out, accompanied by my private secretary, who, like
myself, was clad in white duck. The Insurgent sharpshooters on the
other side of the river devoted some attention to us, but we knew that
so long as they aimed at us we were quite safe. Few of their bullets
came within hearing distance.</p>
<p>We were hunting about on the hillside for the place indicated by
Captain Dyer, when suddenly we heard ourselves cursed loudly and
fluently in extremely plain American, and there emerged from a
neighbouring thicket a very angry infantry officer. On venturing to
inquire the cause of his most uncomplimentary remarks, I found that he
was in command of skirmishers who were going through the brush to see
whether there was anything left there which needed shooting up. As many
of the Insurgent soldiers dressed in white, and as American civilians
were not commonly to be met in Insurgent territory, these men had been
just about to fire on us when they discovered their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>mistake. We went back to Manila and bought some
khaki clothes.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Bureau of Science Building, Manila</p>
<p class="first">This is one of the best equipped laboratory buildings
in the world.</p>
</div>
<p>At first my interest in military matters was not appreciated by my
army friends, who could not see what business I had to be wandering
around without a gun in places where guns were in use. I had, however,
long since discovered that reliable first-hand information on any
subject is likely to be useful sooner or later, and so it proved in
this case.</p>
<p>For several weeks after we reached Manila there was no active
military movement; then came the inauguration of the short, sharp
campaign which ended for the moment with the taking of Malolos. For
long, tedious weeks our soldiers had sweltered in muddy trenches, shot
at by an always invisible foe whom they were not allowed to attack. It
was anticipated that when the forward movement began, it would be
active. Close secrecy was maintained with regard to it. Captain
Hedworth Lambton, of the British cruiser <i>Powerful</i>, then lying in
Manila Bay, exacted a promise from me that I would tell him if I found
out when the advance was to begin, so that we might go to Caloocan
together and watch the fighting from the church tower, which commanded
a magnificent view of the field of operations.</p>
<p>I finally heard a fairly definite statement that our troops would
move the following morning. I rushed to General Otis&rsquo;s office and
after some parleying had it confirmed by him. It was then too late to
advise Lambton, and in fact I could not properly have done so, as the
information had been given me under pledge of secrecy. Accompanied by
my private secretary, Dr. P. L. Sherman, I hastened to Caloocan, where
we arrived just at dusk, having had to run the gantlet of numerous
inquisitive sentries <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p>We spent the night in the church, where General Wheaton and his
staff had their headquarters, and long before daylight were perched in
a convenient opening in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>its galvanized iron roof, made on
a former occasion by a shell from Dewey&rsquo;s fleet.</p>
<p>From this vantage point we could see the entire length of the line
of battle. The attack began shortly after daylight. Near Caloocan the
Insurgent works were close in, but further off toward La Loma they were
in some places distant a mile or more from the trenches of the
Americans.</p>
<p>The general plan of attack was that the whole American line should
rotate to the north and west on Caloocan as a pivot, driving the
Insurgents in toward Malabon if possible. The latter began to fire as
soon as the American troops showed themselves, regardless of the fact
that their enemies were quite out of range. As most of them were using
black-powder cartridges, their four or five miles of trenches were
instantly outlined. The ground was very dry so that the bullets threw
up puffs of dust where they struck, and it was possible to judge the
accuracy of the fire of each of the opposing forces.</p>
<p>Rather heavy resistance was encountered on the extreme right, and
the turning movement did not materialize as rapidly as had been hoped.
General Wheaton, who was in command of the forces about the church,
finally moved to the front, and as we were directly in the rear of his
line and the Insurgents, as usual, overshot badly, we found ourselves
in an uncomfortably hot corner. Bullets rattled on the church roof like
hail, and presently one passed through the opening through which Major
Bourns, Colonel Potter, of the engineer corps, and I were sticking our
heads. Immediately thereafter we were observed by Dr. Sherman making
record time on all fours along one of the framing timbers of the church
toward its tower. There we took up our station, and thereafter observed
the fighting by peeping through windows partially closed with blocks of
volcanic tuff. We had a beautiful opportunity to see the artillery
fire. The guns were directly in front of and below us and we could
watch the laying of the several pieces and then turn our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>field-glasses on the particular portions of the
Insurgent trenches where the projectiles were likely to strike. Again
and again we caught bursting shells in the fields of our glasses and
could thus see their effect as accurately as if we had been standing
close by, without any danger of being perforated by shrapnel.</p>
<p>After the Insurgent position had been carried we walked forward to
their line of trenches and followed it east to a point beyond the La
Loma Church, counting the dead and wounded, as I had heard wild stories
of tremendous slaughter and wanted to see just how much damage the fire
of our troops had really done. On our way we passed the Caloocan
railroad station which had been converted into a temporary field
hospital. Here I saw good Father McKinnon, the champlain of the First
California Volunteers, assisting a surgeon and soaked with the blood of
wounded men. He was one chaplain in a thousand. It was always easy to
find him. One had only to look where trouble threatened and help was
needed. He was sure to be there.</p>
<p>On my way from the railway station to the trenches I met a very much
excited officer returning from the front. He had evidently had a long
and recent interview with Cyrus Noble,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8826src" href="#xd26e8826" name="xd26e8826src">5</a> and was
determined to tell me all about the fighting. I escaped from him after
some delay, and with much difficulty. Later he remembered having met
me, but made a grievous mistake as to the scene of our encounter,
insisting that we had been together in &ldquo;Wheaton&rsquo;s
Hole,&rdquo; an uncommonly hot position where numerous people got hurt.
He persisted in giving a graphic account of our experiences, and in
paying high tribute to my coolness and courage under heavy fire. My
efforts to persuade him that I had not been with him there proved
futile, and I finally gave up the attempt. I wonder how many other
military reputations rest upon so slender <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>a foundation! This
experience was unique. I never saw another officer under the influence
of liquor when in the field.</p>
<p>At the time that we visited the Insurgent trenches, not all of our
own killed and wounded had been removed, yet every wounded Insurgent
whom we found had a United States army canteen of water at his side,
obviously left by some kindly American soldier. Not a few of the
injured had been furnished hardtack as well. All were ultimately taken
to Manila and there given the best of care by army surgeons.</p>
<p>Sometime later a most extraordinary account of this fight, written
by a soldier, was published in the <i>Springfield Republican</i>. It
was charged that our men had murdered prisoners in cold blood, and had
committed all manner of barbarities, the writer saying among other
things:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We first bombarded a town called Malabon and
then entered it and killed every man, woman and child in the
place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The facts were briefly as follows: There was an Insurgent regiment
in and near a mangrove swamp to the right of this town. When it became
obstreperous it was shelled for a short time until it quieted down
again. None of the shells entered the town. Indeed, most of them struck
in the water. Our troops did not enter Malabon that day, but passed to
the northward, leaving behind a small guard to keep the Insurgents from
coming out of Malabon in their rear. Had they then entered the town,
they would not have found any women, children or non-combatant men to
kill for the reason that all such persons had been sent away some time
before. The town was burned, in part, but by the Insurgents themselves.
They fired the church and a great orphan asylum, and did much other
wanton damage.</p>
<p>Being able to speak from personal observation as to the occurrences
of that day, I sent a long cablegram direct to the <i>Chicago
Times-Herald</i> stating the facts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>After my return to
the United States, President McKinley was kind enough to say to me that
if there had been no other result from the visit of the first
Philippine Commission to the islands than the sending of that
cablegram, he should have considered the expense involved more than
justified. He added that the country was being flooded at the time with
false and slanderous rumours, and people at home did not know what to
believe. The statements of army officers were discounted in advance,
and other testimony from some unprejudiced source was badly needed.</p>
<p>On April 2, 1899, Colonel Denby arrived, and our serious work began.
The fighting continued and there was little that we could do save
earnestly to strive to promote friendly relations with the conservative
element among the Filipinos, and to gather the information we had been
instructed to obtain.</p>
<p>On April 4, 1899, we issued a proclamation setting forth in clear
and simple language the purposes of the American government.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8856src" href="#xd26e8856" name="xd26e8856src">6</a>
It was translated into Tag&aacute;log and other dialects and widely
circulated. The Insurgent leaders were alert to keep the common people
and the soldiers from learning of the kindly purposes of the United
States. They were forbidden to read the document and we were reliably
informed that the imposition of the death penalty was threatened if
this order was violated. In Manila crowds of Filipinos gathered about
copies of the proclamation which were posted in public places. Many of
them were soon effaced by Insurgent agents or sympathizers.</p>
<p>This document unquestionably served a very useful purpose.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8861src" href="#xd26e8861" name="xd26e8861src">7</a>
For one thing, it promptly brought us into much closer touch with the
more conservative Filipinos. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>We soon established relations of friendliness and confidence with
men like Arellano, Torres, Legarda and Tavera, who had left the Malolos
government when it demonstrated its futility, and were ready to turn to
the United States for help. Insurgent sympathizers also conferred
freely with us. We were invited to a beautiful function given in our
honour at the home of a wealthy family, and were impressed, as no one
can fail to be, with the dignified bearing of our Filipino hosts, a
thing which is always in evidence on such occasions. We gave a return
function which was largely attended and greatly aided in the
establishment of relations of confidence and friendship with leading
Filipino residents of Manila.</p>
<p>The Filipinos were much impressed with Colonel Denby. He was a
handsome man, of imposing presence, with one of the kindest hearts that
ever beat. They felt instinctively that they could have confidence in
him, and showed it on all occasions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we lost no opportunity to inform ourselves as to
conditions and events, conferring with Filipinos from various parts of
the archipelago and with Chinese, Germans, Frenchmen, Belgians,
Austrians, Englishmen, Spaniards and Americans. Among the witnesses who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>came before us were farmers, bankers, brokers,
merchants, lawyers, physicians, railroad men, shipowners, educators and
public officials. Certainly all classes of opinion were represented,
and when we were called upon by the President, a little later, for a
statement of the situation we felt fully prepared to make it.</p>
<p>Blount has charged that the commission attempted to interfere with
the conduct of the war, and cites a cablegram from General Otis stating
that conferences with Insurgents cost soldiers&rsquo; lives in support
of this contention. No conference with Insurgent leaders was ever held
without the previous knowledge and approval of the general, who was
himself a member of the commission.</p>
<p>Late in April General Luna sent Colonel Arguelles of his staff to
ask for a fifteen days&rsquo; suspension of hostilities under the
pretext of enabling the Insurgent congress to meet at San Fernando,
Pampanga, on May 1, to discuss the situation and decide what it wanted
to do. He called on the commission and urged us to ask Otis to grant
this request, but we declined to intervene, and General Otis refused to
grant it.</p>
<p>Mabini continued Luna&rsquo;s effort, sending Arguelles back with
letters to Otis and to the commission. In the latter he asked for
&ldquo;an armistice and a suspension of hostilities as an indispensable
means of arriving at peace,&rdquo; stating explicitly that the
Philippine government &ldquo;does not solicit the armistice to gain a
space of time in which to re&euml;nforce itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commission again referred Arguelles to General Otis on the
matter of armistice and suspension of hostilities. We suspected that
the statement that these things were not asked for in order to gain
time was false, and this has since been definitely established.</p>
<p>Taylor says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On April 11 Mabini wrote to General Luna
(Exhibit 719) that Aguinaldo&rsquo;s council was of the opinion that no
negotiations for the release of the Spanish prisoners should be
considered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>unless the American Commission agreed to a
suspension of hostilities for the purpose of treating, not only in
regard to the prisoners, but for the purpose of opening negotiations
between Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government and the American authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In arriving at this decision we have been
actuated by the desire to gain time for our arsenals to produce
sufficient cartridges, if, as would seem to be probable, they persist
in not even recognizing our belligerency, as means for furthering the
recognition of our independence.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8903src" href="#xd26e8903" name="xd26e8903src">8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguelles, on his return, was instructed to ask Otis for
a&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;general armistice and suspension of hostilities
in all the archipelago for the short space of three months, in order to
enable it to consult the opinion of the people concerning the
government which would be the most advantageous, and the intervention
in it which should be given to the North American Government, and to
appoint an extraordinary commission with full powers, to act in the
name of the Philippine people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8911src" href="#xd26e8911" name="xd26e8911src">9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Otis naturally again declined to grant the request for a
suspension of hostilities.</p>

</div>
<p>Little came of the conference between Arguelles and the commission,
except that we really succeeded in convincing him of the good
intentions of our government, and this promptly got him into very
serious trouble, as we shall soon see. I took him to a tent hospital on
the First Reserve Hospital grounds where wounded Insurgents were
receiving the best of treatment at the hands of American surgeons, and
he was amazed. He had been taught to believe that the Americans
murdered prisoners, raped women, and committed similar barbarities
whenever they got a chance. As we have seen, stories of this sort were
industriously spread by many of the Insurgent leaders among their
soldiers, and among the common people as well. They served to arouse
the passions of the former, and stirred them up to acts of devilish
brutality which they might perhaps not otherwise have perpetrated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>Arguelles told the truth upon his return, and
this, together with his suggestion that it might be well to consider
the acceptance of the form of government offered by the United States,
nearly cost him his life. Relative to this matter Taylor
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;When Arguelles returned to the insurgent lines,
it must have been considered that he had said too much in Manila. While
he had been sent there to persuade the Americans to agree to a
suspension of hostilities to be consumed in endless discussion under
cover of which Luna&rsquo;s army could be reorganized, he had not only
failed to secure the desired armistice, but had come back with the
opinion that it might after all be advisable to accept the government
proposed by the United States. On May 22 General Luna ordered his
arrest and trial for being in favour of the autonomy of the United
States in the Philippine Islands. He was tried promptly, the
prosecuting witness being another officer of Luna&rsquo;s staff who had
accompanied him to Manila and acted as a spy upon his movements
(P.I.R., 285. 2). The court sentenced him to dismissal and confinement
at hard labor for twelve years. This did not satisfy Luna&rsquo;s
thirst for vengeance, and he was imprisoned in Bautista on the first
floor of a building whose second story was occupied by that officer.
One night Luna came alone into the room where he was confined and told
him that although he was a traitor, yet he had done good service to the
cause; and it was not proper that a man who had been a colonel in the
army should be seen working on the roads under a guard. He told him
that the proper thing for him to do was to blow his brains out, and
that if he did not do it within a reasonable time the sentinel at his
door would shoot him. He gave him a pistol and left the room. Arguelles
decided not to kill himself, but fully expected that the guard would
kill him. Shortly afterwards Luna was summoned to meet Aguinaldo, and
never returned. On September 29, 1899, his sentence was declared null
and void and he was reinstated in his former rank (P.I.R., 285. 3, and
2030. 2).&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8931src" href="#xd26e8931"
name="xd26e8931src">10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Arguelles has told me exactly the same story. For a time it
seemed as if the views expressed by him might prevail. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;According to Felipe Buencamino and some others,
the majority of the members of congress had been in favour of absolute
independence until they saw the demoralization of the officers and
soldiers which resulted in the American occupation of Malolos. In the
middle of April, 1899, they remembered Arellano&rsquo;s advice, and all
of the intelligent men in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government, except Antonio
Luna and the officers who had no desire to lay down their military
rank, decided to accept the sovereignty of the United States. At about
the same time copies of the proclamation issued by the American
Commission in Manila reached them and still further influenced them
toward the adoption of this purpose. By the time congress met in San
Isidro on May 1, 1899, all of the members had accepted it except a few
partisans of Mabini, then president of the council of government. At
its first meeting the congress resolved to change the policy of war
with the United States to one of peace, and this change of policy in
congress led to the fall of Mabini and his succession by Paterno. The
first act of the new council was the appointment of a commission headed
by Felipe Buencamino which was to go to Manila and there negotiate with
the American authorities for an honourable surrender.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8940src" href="#xd26e8940" name=
"xd26e8940src">11</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Although Mabini had fallen from power, Luna and his powerful
faction had still to be reckoned with. He was less moderate than
Mabini, and had armed adherents, which Mabini did not, and when Paterno
declared his policy of moderation and diplomacy he answered it on the
day the new council of government was proclaimed by an order that all
foreigners living in the Philippines except Chinese and Spaniards,
should leave for Manila within forty-eight hours.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8945src" href="#xd26e8945" name=
"xd26e8945src">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately Luna intercepted the Buencamino commission. Its head
he kicked, cuffed and threatened with a revolver. One of its members
was General Gregorio del Pilar. He was allowed to proceed, as he
commanded a brigade of troops which might have deserted had he been
badly treated, but Luna named three other men to go with him in place
of those who had been originally appointed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8951src" href="#xd26e8951" name="xd26e8951src">13</a> They were
Gracio Gonzaga, Captain Zialcita, and Alberto Baretto. They reached
Manila on May 19, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>1899, and during their stay there had two
long interviews with the commission.</p>
<p>They said that they had come, with larger powers than had been
conferred on Arguelles, to discuss the possibility of peace, the form
of ultimate government which might be proposed in future, and the
attitude of the United States government toward needed reforms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on May 4, we had laid before the President a plan of
government informally discussed with Arguelles, and had received the
following reply, authorizing, in substance, what we had
suggested:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Washington, May 5, 1899, 10.20 P.M.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schurman, Manila:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours 4th received. You are authorized to propose that under
the military power of the President, pending action of Congress,
government of the Philippine Islands shall consist of a
governor-general, appointed by the President; cabinet, appointed by the
governor-general; a general advisory council elected by the people; the
qualifications of electors to be carefully considered and determined;
the governor-general to have absolute veto. Judiciary strong and
independent; principal judges appointed by the President. The cabinet
and judges to be chosen from natives or Americans, or both, having
regard to fitness. The President earnestly desires the cessation of
bloodshed, and that the people of the Philippine Islands at an early
date shall have the largest measure of local self-government consistent
with peace and good order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Hay</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8973src" href="#xd26e8973" name="xd26e8973src">14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our proclamation of April 4, 1899, was also taken up at their
request and was gone over minutely, sentence by sentence. We were asked
to explain certain expressions which they did not fully understand.</p>
<p>They told us that it would be hard for their army to lay down its
arms when it had accomplished nothing, and asked if it could be taken
into the service of the United States. We answered that some of the
regiments might <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317"
name="pb317">317</a>]</span>be taken over and employment on public
works be found for the soldiers of others.</p>
<p>We endeavoured to arrange for an interview with Aguinaldo, either
going to meet him or assuring him safe conduct should he desire to
confer with us at Manila.</p>
<p>They left, promising to return in three weeks when they had had time
to consider the matters under discussion, but they never came back.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter there was an odd occurrence. Soon after our
arrival we had learned that Mr. Schurman was a man of very variable
opinions. He was rather readily convinced by plausible arguments, but
sometimes very suddenly reversed his views on an important subject.</p>
<p>At the outset Archbishop Nozaleda made a great impression upon him.
The Archbishop was a thoroughgoing Spaniard of the old school, and
entertained somewhat radical opinions as to what should be done to end
the distressing situation which existed. After talking with him Mr.
Schurman seemed to be convinced that we ought to adopt a stern and
bloody policy, a conclusion to which Colonel Denby and I decidedly
objected.</p>
<p>A little later he made a trip up the Pasig River with Admiral Dewey
and others and had a chance to see something of the aftermath of war.
It was not at all pretty. It never is. I was waiting for him with a
carriage at the river landing on his return and had hard work to keep
him away from the cable office. His feelings had undergone a complete
revulsion. He insisted that if the American people knew what we were
doing they would demand that the war be terminated immediately at any
cost and by whatsoever means, and he wanted to tell them all about it
at once. By the next morning, however, things fortunately looked rather
differently to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Schurman acquired a working knowledge of the Spanish language
with extraordinary promptness. Shortly thereafter Colonel Denby and I
discovered that when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318"
name="pb318">318</a>]</span>Filipinos came to see the commission in
order to impart information or to seek it, he was conferring with them
privately and sending them away without our seeing them at all.</p>
<p>Soon after we had made our formal statement of the situation to the
President, Mr. Schurman had an interview with an Englishman who had
been living in Insurgent territory north of Manila, from which he had
just been ejected, in accordance with Luna&rsquo;s order. This man told
him all about the mistakes of the Americans and evidently greatly
impressed him, for shortly thereafter he read to us at a commission
meeting a draft of a proposed cablegram which he said he hoped we would
approve. It would have stultified us, had we signed it, as it involved
in effect the abandonment of the position we had so recently taken and
a radical change in the policy we had recommended. Mr. Schurman told us
that if we did not care to sign it, he would send it as an expression
of his personal opinion. Colonel Denby asked him if his personal
opinion differed from his official opinion, and received an affirmative
reply. We declined to approve the proposed cablegram, whereupon he
informed us that if his policy were adopted, he and General Aguinaldo
would settle things without assistance from us, and that otherwise he
would resign. He inquired whether we, too, would send a cable, and we
told him certainly not, unless further information from us was
requested. He sent his proposed message, in somewhat modified form, and
received a prompt reply instructing him to submit it to the full
commission and cable their views.</p>
<p>He did submit it to Colonel Denby and myself at a regularly called
commission meeting, argued that in doing this he had obeyed the
President&rsquo;s instructions, and vowed that he would not show it to
General Otis. I showed it to the General myself, allowing him to
believe that I did so with Mr. Schurman&rsquo;s approval, and thus
avoided serious trouble, as he had been personally advised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>from
Washington of the instructions to Mr. Schurman. The General then joined
with Colonel Denby and myself in a cablegram setting forth our views,
and so this incident ended.</p>
<p>Mr. Schurman did not resign, but thereafter we saw very little of
him. He made a hasty trip to the Visayas and the Southern Islands and
sailed for the United States shortly after his return to Manila, being
anxious to get back in time for the opening of the college year at
Cornell.</p>
<p>Colonel Denby and I were instructed to remain at Manila, where we
rendered such assistance as we could give, and continued to gather
information relative to the situation, the country and the people. In
this latter work we were given invaluable help by Jesuit priests, who
prepared for us a comprehensive monograph embodying a very large amount
of valuable information, and furnished us a series of new maps as well.
The latter were subsequently published by the United States Coast and
Geodetic Survey in the form of an Atlas of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Early in September we had a most interesting interview with Sr.
Jos&eacute; de Luzuriaga, a distinguished and patriotic Filipino from
western Negros, where American sovereignty had been accepted without
resistance. Up to that time it had been possible for the people of
Negros to keep out Tag&aacute;log invaders. Sr. Luzuriaga assured us
that so long as this condition continued, there would be no trouble,
and he was quite right.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo&rsquo;s agents eventually gained a foothold there for a
short time, and did some mischief, but it did not result very
seriously.</p>
<p>We felt an especial interest in this island, as General Otis had
asked us carefully to study and to criticise a scheme for its
government which had been drafted by General James F. Smith, who
afterward became justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines,
secretary of public instruction and governor-general of the islands,
and was then in command of the troops in Negros. <span class=

<p>General Lawton arrived in the Philippines during our stay. His
coming had been eagerly looked forward to by the army. He had sailed
with the understanding that he was to be put in charge of field
operations. While he was at sea, influences were brought to bear which
changed this plan.</p>
<p>It is my firm conviction that if Lawton had been put in command, the
war would have ended promptly. He was a wonderful man in the field. He
possessed the faculty of instilling his own tremendous energy into his
officers and men, whose privations and dangers he shared, thereby
arousing an unfaltering loyalty which stood him in good stead in time
of need. If there was fighting to be done, he promptly and thoroughly
whipped everything in sight. He punished looting and disorder with a
heavy hand, treated prisoners and noncombatants with the utmost
kindness, and won the good-will of all Filipinos with whom he came in
contact.</p>
<p>General MacArthur was always declaring that the Filipinos were a
unit against us and that he could never get information from them.
General Lawton never lacked for such information as he needed, and
constantly and successfully used the Filipinos themselves as messengers
and for other purposes. I came to know him intimately, and learned to
admire and love him as did all those who had that great privilege.</p>
<p>For some time I had charge of his spies. Never have men taken longer
chances than did the faithful few who at this time furnished us with
information as to events in Insurgent territory. Discovery meant prompt
and cruel death. For a long time Major F. S. Bourns had performed the
uncongenial task of directing the spies. He was then the chief health
officer of Manila, and as all sorts of people were compelled to consult
him on sanitary matters, visits to his office aroused no suspicion. He
spoke Spanish, and this was imperatively necessary. Our spies simply
would not communicate results through <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>interpreters. The
facts revealed by the Insurgent records show how right they were in
refusing to do so.</p>
<p>Major Bourns eventually returned to the United States. His work was
taken over by an army officer, with the result that two of our best men
died very suddenly in that gentleman&rsquo;s back yard. As I spoke
Spanish, and as all sorts of people came to see the commission, I was
the logical candidate for this job, which I thereupon inherited.</p>
<p>Each morning, if there was news, I myself laboriously thumped out my
notes on the typewriter, making an original and one copy. The copy I
took at once to General Lawton. The original I took, later, to General
Otis.</p>
<p>General Lawton was firmly convinced that most army officers were
unfitted by their training to perform civil functions. He organized
municipal governments with all possible promptness in the towns
occupied by his troops, and in this work he requested my assistance,
which I was of course glad to give. Sr. Felipe Calderon drafted a
simple provisional scheme of municipal government which I submitted for
criticism to that most distinguished and able of Filipinos, Sr.
Cayetano Arellano.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9031src" href=
"#xd26e9031" name="xd26e9031src">15</a> When the final changes in it
had been made, I accompanied General Lawton on a trip to try putting it
into effect. We held elections and established municipal governments in
a number of the towns just south of Manila, and in some of those along
the Pasig River.</p>
<p>General Otis watched our operations and their results narrowly, and
was sufficiently well pleased with the latter to order General
Kobb&eacute; to follow a similar course in various towns on or near the
railroad north of Manila. Kobb&eacute; did not profess to know much
about municipal government, and asked me to go with him and help until
he got the hang of the thing, which I did.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that the first Philippine Commission had a sort of
left-handed interest in the first municipal governments established in
the islands under American rule.</p>

<p>In his endeavour to show that the Commission interfered with
military operations, Blount has ascribed certain statements to Major
Starr. He says: &ldquo;&hellip; at San Isidro on or about November 8,
Major Starr said: &lsquo;We took this town last spring,&rsquo; stating
how much our loss had been in so doing, &lsquo;but partly as a result
of the Schurman commission parleying with the Insurgents, General Otis
had us fall back. We have just had to take it
again.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9046src" href=
"#xd26e9046" name="xd26e9046src">16</a></p>
<p>If Major Starr ever made such a statement he was sadly misinformed.
General Lawton was the best friend I ever had in the United States
Army. I saw him almost daily when he was in Manila, and he showed me
the whole telegraphic correspondence which passed between him and
General Otis on the subject of the withdrawal from San Isidro and Nueva
Ecija, which was certainly one of the most ill advised moves that any
military commander was ever compelled to make. General Lawton&rsquo;s
unremitting attacks had absolutely demoralized the Insurgent force, and
my information is that when he finally turned back, Aguinaldo and
several members of his cabinet were waiting, ten miles away, to
surrender to him when he next advanced, believing that they could never
escape from him. I have not the telegraphic correspondence before me,
but I remember its salient features. Otis ordered Lawton to withdraw,
and Lawton, convinced of the inadvisability of the measure, objected.
Otis replied that, with the rainy season coming on, he could neither
provision him nor furnish him ammunition. Lawton answered that he had
provisions enough to last three weeks and ammunition enough to finish
the war, whereupon Otis peremptorily ordered him to withdraw. The
Philippine Commission had no more to do with this matter than they had
to do with the similar order against advancing which Otis sent Lawton
on the day the latter won the Zapote River fight, when the Insurgents
were running all over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>Province of Cavite. Lawton wanted
to push forward and clean the whole place up. The reply to his request
to be allowed to do so ran, if memory serves me well, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Do nothing. You have accomplished all that was
expected of you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, Lawton and his devoted officers and men had to duplicate
the fierce campaign which had resulted in the taking of San Isidro.
This made possible the movement that Lawton had had in mind in the
first instance, which was made with the result that organized armed
resistance to the authority of the United States promptly ceased in
northern Luz&oacute;n.</p>
<p>While on this subject I wish to record the fact that shortly after
his return from the San Isidro campaign General Lawton asked me to
accompany him on a visit to General Otis and act as a witness. I did
so. In my presence Lawton said to Otis that if the latter would give
him two regiments, would allow him to arm, equip and provision them to
suit himself, and would turn him loose, he would stake his reputation
as a soldier, and his position in the United States Army, on the claim
that within sixty days he would end the insurrection and would deliver
to General Otis one Emilio Aguinaldo, dead or alive. The general
laughed at his offer. General Lawton asked me some day to make these
facts public. As life is an uncertain thing, I deem it proper to do so
now. Personally I am convinced that if his offer had been accepted he
would have kept his promise.</p>
<p>On September 15, 1899, Colonel Denby and I sailed for the United
States, having been recalled to Washington. Shortly after our arrival
there the commission issued a brief preliminary report. The winter was
spent in the preparation of our final report, which constituted a full
and authoritative treatise on the islands, the people and their
resources. Father Jos&eacute; Algu&eacute;, the distinguished
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>head of the Philippine Weather Bureau, was
called to Washington to help us, and gave us invaluable assistance.</p>
<p>Our preliminary report, dated November 2, 1899, and the first volume
of our final report, published on January 31, 1900, contained our
observations and recommendations relative to political matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Schurman has been credited with saying in an address made on
January 11, 1902: &ldquo;Any decent kind of government of Filipinos by
Filipinos is better than the best possible government of Filipinos by
Americans.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9069src" href="#xd26e9069"
name="xd26e9069src">17</a></p>
<p>On November 2, 1900, he signed the following statement:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9075src" href="#xd26e9075" name=
"xd26e9075src">18</a>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Should our power by any fatality be withdrawn,
the commission believe that the government of the Philippines would
speedily lapse into anarchy, which would excuse, if it did not
necessitate, the intervention of other powers and the eventual division
of the islands among them. Only through American occupation, therefore,
is the idea of a free, self-governing, and united Philippine
commonwealth at all conceivable. And the indispensable need from the
Filipino point of view of maintaining American sovereignty over the
archipelago is recognized by all intelligent Filipinos and even by
those insurgents who desire an American protectorate. The latter, it is
true, would take the revenues and leave us the responsibilities.
Nevertheless, they recognize the indubitable fact that the Filipinos
cannot stand alone. Thus the welfare of the Filipinos coincides with
the dictates of national honour in forbidding our abandonment of the
archipelago. We cannot from any point of view escape the
responsibilities of government which our sovereignty entails; and the
commission is strongly persuaded that the performance of our national
duty will prove the greatest blessing to the peoples of the Philippine
Islands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than fourteen years&rsquo; experience in governmental work in
the Philippines has profoundly impressed me with the fundamental
soundness of these conclusions of the first Philippine Commission.
Every statement then made still holds true. <span class=

twenty-four hours before it was so torn and mutilated as to be
unrecognizable. It suffered the same fate as the proclamation of
January 4, set out in pages 113 and 114 of this report, but it produced
a marked beneficial influence on the people, especially those outside
our lines, as it carried with it a conviction of the United

<h2 class="main">The Establishment of Civil Government</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first Philippine Commission did not complete its
work until March, 1900. By this time conditions had so far improved in
the archipelago that President McKinley was prepared to initiate a
movement looking toward the establishment of civil government there.
With this end in view he appointed the following commission of five
civilians; William H. Taft of Ohio, Dean C. Worcester of Michigan, Luke
E. Wright of Tennessee, Henry C. Ide of Vermont and Bernard Moses of
California. Our appointments were dated March 16, 1900. Our
instructions which were full, are given in the appendix.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9093src" href="#xd26e9093" name="xd26e9093src">1</a>
I was the only member of the first commission to be reappointed.
Neither General Otis nor Admiral Dewey cared to serve, and indeed the
professional duties of each of them rendered his appointment to the new
commission difficult, if not impossible. Mr. Schurman had at one time
expressed himself as vigorously opposed to the idea of a new
commission, maintaining that the best results could be obtained by the
appointment of a civil governor with wide powers. It was therefore
taken for granted that he would not desire reappointment. Colonel Denby
was keenly interested in the work and would have been glad to continue
it, but he was past seventy and with his good wife had then spent some
fifteen years in the Far East. He doubted whether his strength would be
adequate to bear the strain of the arduous task which obviously lay
before the new commission, and Mrs. Denby desired to remain in the
United States where she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=
"#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>could be near her children from
whom she had been long separated, so her husband felt constrained to
say that he did not wish to return to the Philippines.</p>
<p>I separated from him with the keenest regret. He was an amiable,
tactful man of commanding ability and unimpeachable integrity, actuated
by the best of motives and loyal to the highest ideals. He constantly
sought to avoid not only evil but the appearance of evil. I count it
one of the great privileges of my life to have been associated with
him. The one thing in the book written by James H. Blount which aroused
my ire was his characterization of Colonel Denby as a hypocrite. No
falser, meaner, more utterly contemptible statement was ever made, and
when I read it the temptation rose hot within me to make public
Blount&rsquo;s personal Philippine record, but after the first heat of
anger had passed I remembered what the good old Colonel would have
wished me to do in such a case, and forbore.</p>
<p>The second Philippine commission, hereinafter referred to as
&ldquo;the commission,&rdquo; received its instructions on April 7,
1900.</p>
<p>They covered a most delicate and complicated subject, namely, the
gradual transfer of control from military to civil authority in a
country extensive regions of which were still in open rebellion.</p>
<p>In the opinion of President McKinley there was no reason why steps
should not be taken, from time to time, to inaugurate governments
essentially popular in their form as fast as territory came under the
permanent control of our troops, and indeed, as we have seen, this had
already been done by the army. It was provided that we should continue
and perfect the work of organizing and establishing civil governments
already commenced by the military authorities. In doing this we were to
act as a board of which Mr. Taft was designated president. It was
contemplated that the transfer of authority from military commanders to
civil officers would be gradual, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327"
href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>and full and complete
co&ouml;peration between these authorities was enjoined. Having
familiarized ourselves with the conditions then prevailing in the
islands, we were to devote our attention first to the establishment of
municipal governments, in which the natives should be given the
opportunity to manage their local affairs to the fullest extent and
with the least supervision and control found to be practicable. We were
then to consider the organization of larger administrative divisions,
and when of the opinion that the condition of affairs in the islands
was such that the central administration could safely be transferred
from military to civil control were to report this conclusion to the
secretary of war with our recommendations as to the form of central
government which should be established.</p>
<p>Beginning with September 1, 1900, we were authorized to exercise,
subject to the approval of the President and the secretary of war, the
legislative power, which was then to be transferred from the military
governor to us until the establishment of civil central government, or
until Congress should otherwise provide. We were authorized during a
like period to appoint to office such officers under the judicial,
educational, and civil service systems, and in the municipal and
departmental governments, as were duly provided for. Until the complete
transfer of control the military governor was to remain the chief
executive head of the government and to exercise the executive
authority previously possessed by him and not expressly assigned to the
commission by the president in his instructions. In establishing
municipal governments we were to take as the basis of our work those
established by the military governor, under the order of August 8,
1899, which I had helped to set up, as well as those established under
the report of a board constituted by the military governor by his order
of January 29, 1900, of which Se&ntilde;or Cayetano Arellano was the
president.</p>
<p>In the establishment of departmental or provincial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>governments we were to give special attention to
the then-existing government of the island of Negros, established with
the approval of the people of that island under the order of the
military governor of July 22, 1899.</p>
<p>We were instructed to investigate troubles growing out of large land
holdings, including those of the religious orders, and to promote,
extend and improve the system of education already inaugurated by the
military authorities, giving first importance to the extension of a
system of primary education free to all, which would tend to fit the
people for the duties of citizenship and the ordinary avocations of a
civilized community. Instruction was to be given at first in the native
dialects, but full opportunity for all of the people to acquire English
was to be provided as soon as possible. If necessity demanded, we were
authorized to make changes in the existing system of taxation and in
the body of the laws under which the people were governed, although
such changes were to be relegated to the civil government which we were
to establish later, so far as might be. Our instructions contained the
following important passages:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In all the forms of government and
administrative provisions which they are authorized to prescribe, the
commission should bear in mind that the government which they are
establishing is designed not for our satisfaction, or for the
expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness, peace and
prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands, and the measures
adopted should be made to conform to their customs, their habits, and
even their prejudices, to the fullest extent consistent with the
accomplishment of the indispensable requisites of just and effective
government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time the commission should bear in mind, and the
people of the islands should be made plainly to understand, that there
are certain great principles of government which have been made the
basis of our governmental system which we deem essential to the rule of
law and the maintenance of individual freedom, and of which they have,
unfortunately, been denied the experience possessed by us; that there
are also certain practical rules of government which we have found to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>be essential to the preservation of these great
principles of liberty and law, and that these principles and these
rules of government must be established and maintained in their islands
for the sake of their liberty and happiness, however much they may
conflict with the customs or laws of procedure with which they are
familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evident that the most enlightened thought of the
Philippine Islands fully appreciates the importance of these principles
and rules, and they will inevitably within a short time command
universal assent. Upon every division and branch of the government of
the Philippines, therefore, must be imposed these inviolable
rules:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law; that private property shall not be
taken for public use without just compensation; that in all criminal
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public
trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to be
confronted with the witnesses against him, to have compulsory process
for obtaining witnesses in his favour, and to have the assistance of
counsel for his defence; that excessive bail shall not be required, nor
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted;
that no person shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offence, or
be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; that
the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall
not be violated; that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall
exist except as a punishment for crime; that no bill of attainder or
ex-post-facto law shall be passed; that no law shall be passed
abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the rights of the
people to peaceably assemble and petition the Government for a redress
of grievances; that no law shall be made respecting the establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the
free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without
discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been the fashion in some quarters to sneer at the last of
these paragraphs, and to insinuate, if not to charge, that President
McKinley in his policy toward the Philippine Islands was actuated by
unworthy motives. Nothing could be further from the truth. From the
beginning to the end the real good of the several peoples <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>of
the archipelago came first with him, and no one who had the privilege
of knowing him well doubts it. Thoroughly imbued with the lofty
sentiments expressed by him in our instructions, we set forth on our
long pilgrimage to a country where we were to undertake a heavy task
essentially different from that which had ever before fallen to the lot
of any five citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>On April 17, 1900, we sailed from San Francisco on the United States
army transport <i>Hancock</i>. We were forty-five strong. Of this
goodly company only four remain in the Philippines to-day,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9143src" href="#xd26e9143" name=
"xd26e9143src">2</a>&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Branagan, Mrs. Worcester and
myself. Singularly enough, with two exceptions, all of the others are
still alive and at work. Arthur W. Ferguson, prince of interpreters,
who was later appointed Executive Secretary, died in the service after
more than six years of extraordinarily faithful and efficient work.
James A. LeRoy, my faithful, able and efficient private secretary,
contracted tuberculosis, and fell a victim to it after a long and
gallant fight.</p>
<p>At Honolulu we met with a severe disappointment. It was of course
our duty to call on Governor Dole. We were advised that silk hats and
frock coats must be donned for this visit, and it was perishing hot. We
reached the palace in a reeking perspiration and had a long wait in a
suffocating room. When Mr. Dole appeared, he was closely followed by an
attendant bearing a large and most attractive-looking bottle carefully
wrapped in a napkin, and our spirits rose. But, alas! It contained
Poland water.</p>
<p>At Tokio we had an audience with the Emperor and were received by
the Empress as well. In the high official who had charge of the palace
where these events took place, I discovered an old University of
Michigan graduate who made the occasion especially pleasant for me.</p>
<p>We finally reached Manila on the morning of June 3. Although the
thermometer was in the nineties, a certain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>frigidity pervaded the atmosphere on our
arrival, which General MacArthur, the military governor, seemed to
regard in the light of an intrusion.</p>
<p>He had been directed to provide suitable office quarters for us. To
our amazement and amusement we found desks for five commissioners and
five private secretaries placed in one little room in the
Ayuntamiento.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9156src" href="#xd26e9156"
name="xd26e9156src">3</a> While it was possible to get through the room
without scrambling over them, it would have been equally possible to
circle it, walking on them, without stepping on the floor. In the
course of our first long official interview with the General, he
informed us that we were &ldquo;an injection into an otherwise normal
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added that we had already mediatized the volume of work that
flowed over his desk. At the moment none of us were quite sure what he
meant, but we found the word in the dictionary. How often in the weary
years that were to follow I wished that some one would materially
mediatize the task which fell to my lot! It was General
MacArthur&rsquo;s honestly held and frankly expressed opinion that what
the Filipinos needed was &ldquo;military government pinned to their
backs for ten years with bayonets.&rdquo; He later changed that view
very radically, and when civil provincial governments were finally
established it was with his approval, and, in many instances, upon his
specific recommendation.</p>
<p>At the outset some effort was made to keep the public away from us.
Word was passed that we had no authority, which was true enough, as our
legislative activities were not to begin until September 1. The ninety
days which intervened were very advantageously spent in gaining
familiarity with the situation, which we had no difficulty in doing.
Plenty of people were already weary of military rule and flocked to us.
None of my companions had ever before set foot in the Philippines, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>although I had spent more than four years there,
I still had plenty to learn.</p>
<p>In this connection I am reminded of an event which occurred somewhat
later. While the commission was en route from Iloilo to Catbalogan when
we were establishing civil provincial governments, General Hughes and
Mr. Taft became involved in a somewhat animated discussion. The General
displayed an accurate knowledge of facts which were of such a nature
that one would hardly have expected an army officer to be familiar with
them. Mr. Taft said: &ldquo;General, how do you do it? You have always
been a busy man, devoted to your profession. How have you managed to
accumulate such a remarkable fund of information?&rdquo; The General
smiled his rare smile and replied: &ldquo;Governor, I will tell you. I
always try to go to bed at night knowing a little more than I did when
I got up in the morning.&rdquo; It is a wise plan to follow.</p>
<p>On September 1 we assumed the legislative power, our first official
act being to appropriate $2,000,000 Mexican for the construction and
repair of highways and bridges.</p>
<p>We were impressed with the fundamental necessity of promptly opening
up lines of land communication in a country which almost completely
lacked them, and there were many poor people in dire need of employment
who would be relieved by the opportunity to earn an honest living which
the inauguration of road construction would afford them.</p>
<p>Our second act appropriated $5000 Mexican for the purpose of making
a survey to ascertain the most advantageous route for a railroad into
the mountains of Benguet, where we wished to establish a much-needed
health resort for the people of the archipelago.</p>
<p>Seven days later we passed an act for the establishment and
maintenance of an efficient and honest civil service in the Philippine
Islands. This measure was of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>basic importance. We had
stipulated before leaving Washington that no political appointees
should be forced upon us under any circumstances. The members of the
second commission, like their predecessors of the first, were firm in
the belief that national politics should, if possible, be kept out of
the administration of Philippine affairs, and we endeavoured to insure
this result.</p>
<p>Our tenth act appropriated $1500 Mexican to be paid to the widow of
Salvador Reyes, vice-president of Santa Cruz in Laguna Province,
assassinated because of his loyalty to the established government.</p>
<p>Our fifteenth act increased the monthly salaries of Filipino public
school teachers in Manila.</p>
<p>Our sixteenth and seventeenth acts reorganized the Forestry Bureau
and the Mining Bureau.</p>
<p>On October 15 we appropriated $1,000,000 United States currency, for
improving the port of Manila, where there was urgent need of protection
for shipping during the typhoon season.</p>
<p>On December 12 we passed an act authorizing the establishment of
local police in cities and towns in the Philippine Islands and
appropriating $150,000 United States currency for their
maintenance.</p>
<p>Two days later we passed a much-needed act regulating the sale of
intoxicating liquors within the city of Manila and its attached
barrios.</p>
<p>On December 21, we appropriated $75,000 United States currency for
the construction of the Benguet Road, little dreaming how much time
would elapse and how many more dollars would be appropriated, before a
vehicle passed over it.</p>
<p>It will be sufficiently evident that I cannot here give an account
of the several acts which we passed when I say that they number four
hundred forty-nine during the first year. We created the administrative
bureaus of a well-organized government, established civil rule in
numerous municipalities and provinces, provided for the necessary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>expenses of government, organized courts and
reformed the judiciary. So important were the results following the
establishment of the Civil Service Act and the act providing for the
organization of courts for the Philippine Islands that I have devoted a
chapter to each.</p>
<p>Although there were no limits on our power to enact legislation
other than those imposed by our instructions hereinbefore referred to,
nothing was further from our desire than to exercise too arbitrarily
the authority conferred upon us.</p>
<p>Taylor has correctly described our method of procedure in the
following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On September 1, 1900, the Commission began its
legislative and executive duties. In performing them it adopted the
policy of passing no laws, except in cases of emergency, without
publishing them in the daily press, nor until after they had passed a
second reading and the public had been given an opportunity to come
before the Commission and suggest objections or amendments to the
bills. Before enacting them they were submitted to the military
governor for his consideration and comment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e9204src" href="#xd26e9204" name="xd26e9204src">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other especially important events of our first legislative year
were the establishment of civil rule in the municipalities as well as
in thirty-eight provinces and the substitution of the military central
government by the gradual creation of bureaus and the ultimate
appointment of a civil governor and of five heads of executive
departments.</p>
<p>On November 23, 1900, we passed an act providing for the
establishment of a civil government in the province of Benguet, and
thus it happened that a province practically all of whose inhabitants
were members of a non-Christian tribe was the first to enjoy the
benefits of civil rule. This action grew out of investigations by
General Wright and myself made when visiting Baguio during the latter
part of July, which led us to the conclusion that civil government
could be established in Benguet at any time and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>should be established as soon as possible. In
view of the rather primitive state of civilization of the people for
whom we were legislating, a special act adapted to local conditions was
passed providing for a provincial government and fixing a form of
government for the several settlements.</p>
<p>On January 31, 1901, we passed an act for the organization of
municipal governments in the Philippine Islands which, with various
amendments, is still in effect and has been made applicable to all
municipal corporations of the Philippines inhabited chiefly by
Filipinos, except the city of Manila, the city of Baguio and a few
small settlements in the so-called special government
provinces.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9215src" href="#xd26e9215" name=
"xd26e9215src">5</a></p>
<p>On February 6, 1901, we passed a general act for the organization of
provincial governments in the Philippine Islands. A special act was
required to make it applicable to any given province.</p>
<p>Having thus prepared for the serious work of establishing civil
government throughout the archipelago so fast and so far as conditions
might seem to justify, we determined to visit the several provinces and
to familiarize ourselves with conditions on the ground in each case
before taking action. We invariably sought the opinion of the military
authorities as to the fitness of the provinces under consideration for
civil rule, and never established it except with their approval.
Indeed, in several cases we yielded to their judgment and organized
provinces which we ourselves thought might better wait for a time.</p>
<p>Our first trip was to the northward along the line of the
Manila-Dagupan railway, and in the course of it we organized the
provinces of Bulaean, Pampanga, Tarlac and Pangasin&aacute;n.</p>
<p>On the 2d of March we crossed Manila Bay to Bataan and established a
civil provincial government there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336"
href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first provincial officers were necessarily appointed, not
elected. I well remember the consternation which Mr. Taft created on
this trip, when in announcing the appointment of a man of strong
character who was much disliked by some of the people present, he said
that if the appointee did not behave well his official head would be
promptly removed. Surprise showed on almost every face in the audience.
They had become sufficiently accustomed to the idea of being beheaded
or otherwise sent out of the world by their own people, but had been
led to believe that the Americans were a humane nation, and it took Mr.
Taft at least five minutes to explain his joke.</p>
<p>During the second week in March the commission transferred its
officers bodily to the United States Army Transport <i>Sumner</i> and
started on a long journey in the course of which it visited and
established provincial governments in eighteen provinces,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9234src" href="#xd26e9234" name="xd26e9234src">6</a>
returning to Manila on the 3d of May.</p>
<p>This trip was most interesting but dreadfully wearing. Everywhere we
were overwhelmed by the hospitality of our Filipino friends. We arrived
at some new place nearly every morning, and the programme in each was
much the same. After an early breakfast we hurried ashore, drove or
walked about for a short time to see what the town was like, and then
attended a popular meeting in its largest building, where we held long
and frank converse with the people on local conditions, giving them
every opportunity to air their views, with the result that the local
orators, of whom there were usually more than a sufficiency, had an
opportunity to bring their heavy guns into action. Then followed a
recess in the course of which we partook of a very elaborate lunch, and
when possible conferred privately with influential <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>men,
often learning things which they did not care to tell us in public.
Then came another open meeting at which the actual organization of the
province was effected and the officials were appointed and sworn in.
After this there was a long formal dinner, with the endless courses
which characterize such functions in the Philippines, and then came a
ball which lasted till the wee small hours. When at last we got on
board, tired out, our steamer sailed, and often brought us to some new
place by sunrise.</p>
<p>In several instances we did not pass the act organizing a given
province at the time of our visit, but for one reason or another
postponed action until a later date. We visited a number of places like
Jol&oacute;, Basilan, Zamboanga, Cotabato, Davao and Samar, where we
had no intention of establishing civil government, in order to observe
local conditions.</p>
<p>We touched at Marinduque on our trip south, and found that nothing
could then be done there, but the better element were anxious for a
change, and we promised them that if they would bring about certain
specified results before our return we would give them a provincial
government. They undertook to do so, and kept their word. Needless to
say we also kept ours.</p>
<p>We had grave doubts as to the advisability of establishing civil
governments in Ceb&uacute;, Bohol and Batangas. In the first of these
places the people were sullen and ugly. In the second there was a
marked disinclination on the part of leading citizens to accept public
office. There had been a little scattering rifle fire on the outskirts
of the capital of the third very shortly before our arrival there, but
the organization of all these provinces was recommended by the military
authorities, and we decided to try an experiment which could do little
harm, as we could return any one of them to military control in short
order should such a course seem necessary.</p>
<div class="figure p043width" id="p043"><img src="images/p043.jpg" alt=
"A Modern Primary School Building" width="720" height="419">
<p class="figureHead">A Modern Primary School Building</p>
<p class="first">Contrast this structure with the native houses near
it.</p>
</div>
<p>An effort has been made to make it appear that in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>organizing Ceb&uacute;, Bohol and Batangas, we
acted prematurely and upon our own initiative, thus complicating the
situation for the military authorities. I will let Blount voice this
complaint. He says in part:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In his report for 1901 Governor Taft says that
the four principal provinces, including Batangas, which gave trouble
shortly after the civil government was set up in that year, and had to
be returned to military control, were organized under civil rule
&lsquo;on the recommendation&rsquo; of the then commanding general
(MacArthur). It certainly seems unlikely that the haste to change from
military rule to civil rule came on the motion of the military. If the
Commission ever got, <i>in writing,</i> from General MacArthur, a
&lsquo;recommendation&rsquo; that any provinces be placed under civil
rule while still in insurrection, the text of the writing will show a
mere soldierly acquiescence in the will of Mr. McKinley, the
commander-in-chief. Parol<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9265src" href=
"#xd26e9265" name="xd26e9265src">7</a> contemporaneous evidence will
show that General MacArthur told them, substantially, that they were
&lsquo;riding for a fall.&rsquo; In fact, whenever an insurrection
would break out in a province after Governor Taft&rsquo;s inauguration
as governor, the whole attitude of the army in the Philippines, from
the commanding general down was &lsquo;I told you so.&rsquo; They did
not say this where Governor Taft could hear it, but it was common
knowledge that they were much addicted to damning
&lsquo;politics&rsquo; as the cause of all the trouble.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9268src" href="#xd26e9268" name=
"xd26e9268src">8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prophecy is always dangerous and when unnecessary seems rather
inexcusable. I submit the essential portions of the record to show
exactly what we did get from General MacArthur, and add the suggestion
that it was really hardly essential that he should make his
recommendations in writing, as he did, for the reason that he was a
gentleman and would not have repudiated a verbal recommendation once
made.</p>
<p>On February 5, 1901, Governor Taft wrote General MacArthur a letter
closing with the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;As already communicated to you the purpose of
the Commission is to make a Southern trip on the 23rd of February, or
as soon thereafter as practicable, with the idea of arranging
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>for provincial governments there, and I am
directed by the Commission to request your opinion as to the provinces
in which provincial governments may be safely established. It is
understood that Panay, Romblon, Tayabas, and possibly one or two of the
Camarines are ready for this. What has been said with reference to the
Northern provinces applies to these, but we shall communicate with you
further as to the Southern provinces when we have been advised as to
the possibility of securing a steamer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On February 9, General MacArthur gave the following instructions to
the Commanding General, Department of the Visayas:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Military Governor desires that you report
to this office at the earliest date practicable the provinces in your
department that may be considered ready for the establishment of civil
governments therein and in this connection directs me to say that it
should not be considered as necessary that complete pacification has
been brought about in a province before reporting it as ready for such
government; that the provincial civil governments to be established
will doubtless prove useful agents in the further work of
pacification.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On February 27, that officer reported that in his opinion Iloilo,
Capiz, Oriental Negros and Occidental Negros were ready; that Antique
might be in a few days, and that Ceb&uacute;, Bohol and Leyte were not.
These facts were reported to Governor Taft by General MacArthur on
March 4, and on the same day Lieutenant-Colonel Crowder wrote to the
commanding general of the Visayas:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Military Governor directs me to say that he
regards the initiation of provincial civil government as an aid in the
work of pacification, in which view it is not necessary that a province
should be completely pacified as a condition to the initiation of such
government. He has expressed to the Commission the opinion that you may
be able, upon their arrival at Iloilo, to submit a supplementary list
of provinces in which it would be advisable to establish at once these
governments.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile General MacArthur wrote on February 13, to Governor
Taft:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In partial reply to your letter of the 5th
instant I have the honor to inform you that the Commanding General,
Department of Southern Luzon, reports but one province, Tayabas, as
ready at the present time for civil government. I add the provinces of
Laguna, Batangas and Cavite, believing that the institution of civil
government in all these provinces will be in assistance of the military
authorities in the work of pacification.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General MacArthur&rsquo;s communications seem to me to show
something more than &ldquo;a mere soldierly acquiescence in the will of
Mr. McKinley,&rdquo; especially as the President had no knowledge of
these provinces, and never made any recommendation whatsoever relative
to the establishment of civil government there.</p>
<p>Similarly, in establishing civil government in Cebu and Bohol, the
commission acted on the specific recommendation of the military, and
rather against its own judgment. There seemed no very good reason for
refusing to try civil government, if the commanding general wanted it
tried, and when it failed, as it promptly did, in Cebu, Bohol and
Batangas, these provinces were immediately returned to the full control
of the military, and left there until conditions became
satisfactory.</p>
<p>Having escaped the perils of the deep, and the much graver perils of
the dinner table, during our southern trip, we returned to Manila,
wearier, wiser and sadder men than when we started, for we had learned
much of the superstitions, the ignorance and the obsessions which
prevailed among the Filipinos, and we knew that many of the men who
from love of country had accepted office under us had done so at the
peril of their lives. We had all had an excellent opportunity to come
to know the Filipinos. Their dignity of bearing, their courtesy, their
friendly hospitality, their love of imposing functions, and of
<i>fiestas</i> and display, their childishness and irresponsibility in
many matters, their passion for gambling, for litigation and for
political intrigue, even the loves and the hatreds of some of them, had
been spread before us like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href=
"#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>an open book. It is a fact that
except for the inhabitants of Cebu, Bohol and Batangas, the people
wanted what we had to give them and were grateful for it. Never before
had they had their day in court, and they appreciated it.</p>
<p>The establishment of civil government throughout so large a
proportion of the provinces in the islands would have been impossible
at this time had it not been for the helpful activities of the Federal
Party organized on December 23, 1900, by many of the best and most
influential Filipinos in the archipelago for the purpose of aiding in
the establishment of peace and order. Its members were tireless in
their activities. They succeeded in persuading many Insurgent leaders
to lay down their arms, so that a normal condition could be restored in
territory which the latter had previously harried. They convinced many
of the common people of the true purposes of the American government,
and in numerous other ways rendered invaluable services.</p>
<p>The officers and many of the members and agents of this party were
promptly sentenced to death by Aguinaldo, and many of them were
assassinated;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9316src" href="#xd26e9316"
name="xd26e9316src">9</a> but the party persisted in its efforts until
success was attained.</p>
<p>During June of 1901 Professor Moses and I made a horseback trip
through Pangasin&aacute;n, La Union, Benguet, Lepanto and Ilocos Sur,
accompanied by our private secretaries. Professor Moses was in wretched
health as the result of overwork and confinement, and needed
out-of-door exercise.</p>
<p>I had been intrusted with the drafting of legislation for the
government of the non-Christian tribes, and wanted to learn as much
about them as possible, so that I could act intelligently.</p>
<p>We started from Dagupan mounted on horses kindly furnished us by the
army, and escorted by four mounted infantrymen. None of us had ridden
for years, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>army officers were offering wagers that we would
not get as far as Baguio. At Mangaldan a cavalry outfit replaced our
mounted infantrymen, and while the members of our new escort were
resting under the shade of a tree in the cemetery, I heard them voicing
joyful anticipations of the easy time they were to have travelling with
tenderfeet. I made up ray mind to give them some healthful exercise on
the trip.</p>
<p>Having first visited the work at the lower end of the Benguet Road
and then travelled across country in a driving storm over wretched
trails, we reached Bauang, our point of departure for the interior.
Here I called the sergeant in charge and asked him where were the extra
shoes for our horses. In some confusion he confessed that he had
brought none, whereupon I read him a homily on the duties of a
cavalryman, and sent the whole outfit to San Fernando to get the horses
reshod and provided with extra shoes for the trip.</p>
<p>We arrived at Baguio in a howling typhoon. When we emerged from the
hills into the open, and our horses got the full sweep of the storm,
they at first refused to face it. We forced them into it, however, and
a few moments later had found refuge in the house of Mr. Otto Scheerer,
a hospitable German. The cavalrymen and the horses got in under the
building. It gave me great joy to hear through the floor the voice of
the sergeant remarking, with much emphasis of the sort best represented
in print by dashes, that if he had known the sort of a trip he was
starting on he would have been on sick report the morning of his
departure.</p>
<p>We waited in vain three days for the storm to end and then rode on.
Mr. Scheerer, who accompanied us, had sent ahead to arrange for lunch
at the house of a rich Igorot named Acop, but when we arrived at this
man&rsquo;s place, soaked, cold, and hungry, we found it shut up. He
had not received the message and was away from home. Investigation
showed that our only resource in the commissary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>line
were some wads of sticky, unsalted, boiled rice which our Igorot
carriers had inside their hats, in contact with their frowsy hair. We
bolted as much of this as the Igorots could spare, killing its rather
high flavour with cayenne peppers picked beside the trail, and
continued our journey. In descending a steep hill my horse stumbled and
while attempting to recover himself drove a sharp stone into his hoof
and turned a complete somersault, throwing me over his head on to the
rocks. When I got him up he was dead lame, and I walked the rest of the
way to Ambuklao, where we arrived just at sunset.</p>
<p>This once prosperous little Igorot hamlet had been burned by the
Spaniards, for no apparent reason, during their flight from the
province in 1906, and we found only two houses standing. They were
naturally crowded. I was so dead with fatigue that I threw my saddle on
the ground, and using it as a pillow, lay down in a couple of inches of
water and fell sound asleep. Later the Igorots vacated one of the
houses, and placed it at our disposal. I spent the greater part of the
night in a contest with an old Igorot woman, who for the commendable
purpose of keeping us warm tended a smoky pitch-pine fire, and shut the
door, which afforded our only means of ventilation, every time I
dropped asleep. Awakened by the stifling smoke I would open it again,
but as soon as I dozed she would shut it. I finally solved the problem
by lying down with my head sticking out of the door.</p>
<p>The next day was bright and clear. We rested until noon, drying out
our belongings meanwhile, and then continued our journey, visiting the
Igorot settlements on the Agno River and those in southern Lepanto and
finally reaching Cervantes, the capital of that sub-province. The
Igorots of Benguet and Lepanto received us with the utmost
friendliness, and when not in danger of breaking our necks by falling
over the edges of the wretched trails, we greatly enjoyed our trip.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Cervantes we were met by a delegation of Bontoc Igorots, who
begged us to visit their country, and we were just preparing to do so
when we received a telegram recalling us to Manila to be present at the
inauguration of Mr. Taft as civil governor. During our absence the
commission had established provincial governments in Rizal, Cavite and
Nueva Ecija. Mr. Taft was inaugurated on July 4, 1901. Thenceforth he
exercised control over the provinces where civil government had been
established, while the military governor continued in charge of each of
the remaining provinces until it was duly organized and transferred to
civil control.</p>
<p>In August, 1901, the commission sailed on a tour of the remaining
northern provinces, visiting La Union, Ilocos Sur, Abra, Ilocos Norte,
Cagayan, Isabela and Zambales in the order named, and establishing a
government in each. On the trip to Abra those members of the commission
not previously accustomed to roughing it in the islands were given a
novel experience, for we went up the Abra River on bamboo rafts.
However, a veritable ship of state had been prepared for Governor Taft,
and no one suffered any great discomfort.</p>
<p>At Vigan, the capital of Ilocos, we narrowly escaped drowning in the
surf when returning to our steamer. For a time our good

headway through the rolling waves. It broached to, nearly filled with
water, and struck the bottom heavily several times. Some of the men
quit rowing and began to pray, whereupon General J. F. Bell, who was
sitting in the stern, rose to his feet, and shouted at them until they
became more afraid of him than of the sea, and pulled for dear life
until we were out of danger. Upon arrival at the ship we watched with
interest the progress of other boats through the surf, and were alarmed
to see the men in one madly divesting themselves of their clothing.

flying leaps for the gangway, and we discovered that a great hole had
been knocked in its bottom, and that raincoats, ordinary coats, and
trousers had been jammed into this opening in order to keep the rapidly
sinking craft afloat for a few moments.</p>
<p>In the Cagayan valley we had a taste of real tropical heat. Never
have I seen a man suffer more than did Mr. Taft at Ilagan on the day
when we established a provincial government for Isabela, and the night
that followed still lingers in my memory. The air was suffocating. My
bed was in a corner. I dragged it out between a window and a door and
threw both wide open. Still I could not sleep. Slipping off my pajamas,
I seated myself on the broad window sill. The heat was intolerable. I
poured water over myself and resumed my seat in the window. The water
would not evaporate. I sat there until morning, as I could not endure
the heat lying down.</p>
<p>Such conditions are unknown throughout the greater part of the
archipelago, where cool sea breezes temper the heat at all times. In
the Cagayan valley an immense plain is bordered by ranges of high
mountains to the east and the west. They seem to shut off both monsoons
to a considerable extent, and there very trying heat is by no means
unusual.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1901, the first day of the second year of actual
service of the commission, a complete central civil government was
established. Commissioner Wright was appointed secretary of commerce
and police; Commissioner Ide, secretary of finance and justice;
Commissioner Moses, secretary of public instruction, and I myself
secretary of the interior. The commission was strengthened by the
addition of three Filipino members: Se&ntilde;or Benito Legarda,
Se&ntilde;or Jos&eacute; R. de Luzuriaga, and Dr. T. H. Pardo de
Tavera, all of whom were men of exceptional ability and had rendered
distinguished service in the establishment of peace and order.</p>

1908, the organization of the commission has remained unchanged up to
the present time, although there have been numerous changes in its
personnel. The task which lay before it was to enact a code of laws
adapted to the peculiar conditions existing in the Philippines, and
this was indeed a herculean undertaking. Its members laboured
unremittingly. Governor Taft and General Wright were towers of strength
in the early days. The rest of us did what we could, and I, for one, am
very proud of the result. Certainly no one can ever claim that the
commission was not industrious. Before it finally ceased to be the
legislative body of the islands it had passed some eighteen hundred
acts. Obviously, as it is not my purpose to write an encyclopedia of
law, I cannot discuss them in detail, and must content myself with here
barely mentioning a few of the more important results obtained, leaving
the more detailed discussion of some of them for later chapters.</p>
<p>In general, it may be said that the additional bureaus necessary for
the work of the Insular government were created, and given proper
powers. Civil government was gradually extended to the entire
archipelago.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9380src" href="#xd26e9380"

<p>It is a noteworthy fact that all of these things were done with a
per capita taxation of about $2.24!</p>
<p>Another fundamentally important aid to the commercial development of
the islands was afforded by a radical reformation of the currency.</p>
<p>The islands under the sovereignty of Spain had their own distinct
silver coinage in peso, media peso, peseta and media peseta pieces.</p>
<p>In 1878 the Spanish government, hoping to check the heavy
exportation of gold currency from the Philippines, passed a law
prohibiting the importation of Mexican dollars, but allowed the Mexican
dollars then in the islands to continue to circulate as legal
tender.</p>
<p>When the American troops arrived, there were in circulation the
Spanish-Philippine peso and subsidiary silver coins; Spanish pesos of
different mintings; Mexican pesos of different mintings; Hongkong
dollars, fractional silver coins from different Chinese countries, and
copper coins from nearly every country in the Orient. Although a law
had been passed prohibiting the introduction of Mexican dollars into
the islands, they were being constantly smuggled in. Fluctuations in
the price of silver affected the value of the silver coins, and the
money in common use was in reality a commodity, worth on any given day
what one could get for it. These conditions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>affected most disastrously the business
interests of the islands. Merchants were forced to allow very wide
margins in commercial transactions, because they did not know what
their goods would actually cost them in local currency upon arrival.
The most important business of the local banks was in reality that of
exchange brokers and note shavers. They hammered the exchange rate down
and bought silver, then boosted the rate skyward and sold.</p>
<p>The American army brought in a large amount of gold, but this did
not remain in circulation long, as it was exported by the different
business concerns, or hoarded.</p>
<p>United States silver money had a limited circulation during the
early days of American occupation, but it passed at less than its true
value. An effort was made under the military administration to keep the
ratio of exchange at two to one by the purchase from the public of all
United States currency offered at that rate to the banks.</p>
<p>For a long time the banks refused to carry private accounts in
United States currency, but when it was offered for deposit it was
changed into Mexicans with a heavy charge for the transaction, and an
account opened in Mexican currency to the credit of the depositor. If
the depositor afterward desired to get United States currency, he gave
a check for it at the then existing rate of exchange. Such conditions
were intolerable, and the commission passed an act making it an offence
to refuse to accept for deposit the currency of the sovereign power,
but this did not remedy the fundamental difficulty. There came a heavy
slump in the price of silver. The Insular government lost a very large
sum because of the decrease in value of its silver coin.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles A. Conant had been brought from the United States to
make a report on the feasibility of providing an American coinage for
the islands. He recommended that the unit of value should be a peso,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>equivalent to fifty cents United States
currency. Congress, by an act passed July 1, 1902, vested general
authority over the coinage in the Philippine government, but the
commission decided not to take action until more specific authority
could be obtained from Congress, as the proposed reform was radical,
and it was very important that the new currency should at the outset
command the confidence so essential to its success.</p>
<p>After long discussion, Congress authorized, by an act passed March
2, 1903, a new currency system based on a theoretical peso of 12.9
grains of gold 900 fine, equivalent to one-half of a United States gold
dollar. The circulating medium was to be the Philippine silver peso,
which was to be legal tender for all debts, public and private, and its
value was to be maintained on a parity with the theoretical gold peso.
For this purpose the creation of a gold standard, or gold reserve fund,
was provided for, and this fund was to be maintained and could be used
for no other purpose.</p>
<p>Considerable difficulty was experienced in introducing the new
currency into the islands. The banks at first failed to give any
assistance to the government. The business men of Manila, and
especially the Chinese, discounted the new Philippine peso, because it
did not contain as much silver as did the Mexican dollar. They were
quickly brought to time, and given to understand where they stood if
they discredited the currency of the country.</p>
<p>The Spanish Philippine coins and the Mexican coins in circulation
were collected by the treasury and exported to the San Francisco mint,
where they were reminted into new coins of the weight and fineness
prescribed by law.</p>
<p>The establishment of a gold standard fund to maintain the parity
between the gold and silver dollar was quickly effected by the sale of
exchange on the United States in accordance with the established law,
at a cost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>estimated to be the same as the transportation
of the gold coin itself.</p>
<p>The army, by direction of the secretary of war, ceased to pay in
United States money, and its paymasters were given credit at the
Insular Treasury, where they obtained the necessary funds in Philippine
currency.</p>
<p>The government also authorized, in addition to the coinage of
silver, the issuance of paper money in two, five, and ten peso notes.
All of the coins and bills were readily interchangeable with the United
States coins in common use, the dollar being worth two pesos, the half
dollar one peso, the twenty-five cent piece a half peso, the ten-cent
piece a peseta, the five-cent piece a media peseta and the cent two
centavos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the silver value of the new peso was such that when
the price of silver again rose, its bullion value was greater than its
money value, and in consequence coins of this denomination were hoarded
and exported. It proved necessary to prohibit their exportation, and to
issue new coins of less bullion value, but this was the only really
serious difficulty attending a fundamental reform which put the
currency on a sound basis. The original pesos were recoined and a
handsome profit made on the transaction.</p>
<p>No one who has not lived in a country where the circulating medium
is constantly fluctuating in value can fully appreciate the enormous
benefit conferred on the Philippine Islands by this important
reform.</p>
<p>Another reform of far-reaching importance was the readjustment of
the burden of taxation so that it should bear lightly on the
necessities of life, and heavily on its luxuries. This was a complete
reversal of the scheme which we found in force, under which wheat flour
and kerosene oil paid very heavy import duties while cigars and
champagne were lightly taxed.</p>
<p>We imposed export taxes on certain products of the country. Such
taxes are objected to by many political <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>economists, but were
approved of by the Filipinos, who strongly opposed the imposition of a
logical and very necessary personal tax to provide funds for the
construction and maintenance of highways and bridges. It is usually
wise, when practicable, to obtain funds for necessary governmental
purposes by the imposition of taxes which are willingly paid.</p>
<p>Mr. Taft resigned the governorship of the Philippines to become
secretary of war, his resignation taking effect January 31, 1904. He
had performed a monumental work for the Filipinos, and for humanity at
large, during his years of service in the islands, and carried with him
the good will of most of the people whom he had so faithfully,
efficiently and self-sacrificingly served. He had at one time very
gravely impaired his health by hard work, and when the opportunity came
to satisfy a lifelong ambition by accepting appointment as a Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States, he had passed it by, in order
to perform his duty to the people of the Philippine Islands. As
secretary of war, and as President of the United States, he availed
himself of every opportunity which these high offices afforded to help
the Filipinos, and to increase the prosperity of their country. They
have had no better friend, and no other friend whom they have ever had
has been so useful to them. One more proof of his real greatness is
afforded by the fact that to-day, after being reviled by many Filipino
politicians whom he befriended, who have succeeded to a large degree in
making the common people of the Philippines consider him their enemy,
his interest in the people of the Islands is as keen, and his eagerness
to help them is as great, as in the early days when they acclaimed him
their deliverer.</p>
<p>General Luke E. Wright, a democrat of Memphis, Tennessee, was
appointed by President Roosevelt civil governor in Mr. Taft&rsquo;s
place. He rendered his country and the Filipinos most distinguished
service. It is one thing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href=
"#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>to build up a great government,
with numerous political appointments at one&rsquo;s disposal, and
another to stand by and keep it running smoothly and efficiently, when
a lot of disappointed politicians, who have seen their last hope of
political preferment go a-glimmering, are throwing sand into the
bearings of the machine. This latter class had begun to plot against
Governor Taft before his resignation took effect, but their
machinations were rendered fruitless by the wave of regret raised by
his coming departure.</p>
<p>They now devoted themselves, with a good deal of success, to
injuring Governor Wright, who declined to be dictated to, in the matter
of appointments, by the Federal Party, and aroused the ire of many
politicians by occasionally telling the Filipinos unpalatable but
wholesome and necessary truths relative to their fitness for immediate
independence.</p>
<p>General Wright, whose title had been changed from governor to
governor-general on February 6, 1905, went on leave during the latter
part of that year, fully expecting to return and resume his work in the
Philippines, but the islands were not to see him again. He resigned,
effective April 1, 1906, to become United States Ambassador to Japan.
In my opinion, the acceptance of his resignation at this time was one
of the gravest mistakes ever made in the Philippine policy of the
United States. The islands were deprived of the services of a very able
and distinguished man, thoroughly conversant with their needs, who had
the courage of his convictions, and whose convictions were thoroughly
sound.</p>
<p>Certain Filipino politicians openly boasted that they had secured
his removal, and they and their ilk were encouraged to put forth new
and pernicious efforts. Had General Wright returned to the islands much
of the political unrest from which they have since suffered would have
been avoided. He was beloved by his associates, who felt a sense of
personal loss when they learned that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>the places which had
known him in The Philippines would know him no more.</p>
<p>He was succeeded for the brief period of five and a half months by
Judge Henry C. Ide, vice-governor and secretary of finance and justice,
who had performed his duties while he was on leave. Judge Ide was a
republican, from Vermont. He resigned on September 19, 1906.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by General James F. Smith, a democrat from
California, who had come to the islands as a colonel of volunteers, and
had won promotion because of his valuable services in the Visayas, and
more especially in the island of Negros, where he had earned the good
will of the Filipinos by his tact and kindness. Later he had served,
unwillingly, as head of the Manila custom house.</p>
<p>He was subsequently made a justice of the supreme court of the
Philippines. A lawyer by profession, he had resigned this position with
regret to accept appointment, on January 1, 1903, as secretary of
public instruction. He did not desire the governor-generalship and made
a strong but unsuccessful effort to avoid accepting the position, which
he finally took from a sense of duty. He was a good lawyer, with a big
heart, and a keen insight into human nature. He thoroughly understood
the Filipinos, and he made an excellent governor-general. It was during
his term of office that the Philippine Legislature, composed of an
upper appointive house, the Philippine Commission, and a lower elective
house, the Philippine Assembly, met for the first time on October 16,
1907.</p>
<p>I devote a separate chapter<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9490src"
href="#xd26e9490" name="xd26e9490src">22</a> to the Philippine
Legislature and its work, so need not discuss it here. Suffice it to
say that such success as attended the work of this body during its
inaugural, first and special sessions, was very largely due to the
tactful influence of Governor-General Smith, who gave the speaker of
the assembly much valuable, friendly counsel, and kept the two houses
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>working in comparative harmony. Having struggled
through one session of the legislature, Governor-General Smith felt at
liberty to resign. He greatly desired to leave the Philippine
government service and return to the practice of his profession. His
resignation was reluctantly accepted, about a year after he had
tendered it, and he left the service on November 10, 1909.</p>

</div>
<p>He was succeeded by Vice-Governor W. Cameron Forbes, a republican
from Massachusetts, who had accepted appointment as secretary of
commerce and police on June 15, 1904. A man of independent means, Mr.
Forbes entered the public service only because of the opportunity for
greater usefulness which was thus afforded him. He brought to bear on
the problems which confronted him as secretary of commerce and police
intelligence and ability of a very high order. Wide practical
experience in the management of large business interests had admirably
fitted him to improve the organization and increase the efficiency of
the insular police force, and to mature and carry out plans for
bettering means of communication and otherwise facilitating and
stimulating the normal, healthful commercial development of the
islands. I have devoted several chapters to the discussion of the
results accomplished along these lines,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9504src" href="#xd26e9504" name="xd26e9504src">23</a> and will
not attempt here to enumerate them.</p>
<p>Like all of his predecessors, he brought to the office of
governor-general mature experience gained on the ground, having been in
the service more than five years at the time of his promotion.</p>
<p>As governor-general, he not only retained his keen interest in the
large problems which had previously engaged his attention, and laboured
unceasingly and most successfully in the performance of the duties of
his new office, but took an especial interest in the development of the
summer capital, and in the work for the non-Christian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>peoples of the islands, devoting a much greater
amount of time and attention to familiarizing himself with the needs of
this portion of the population than had ever previously been given to
it by any governor-general. He visited the Moros and the Bukidnons in
the south, and the Negritos, the Benguet Igorots, the Lepanto Igorots,
the Bontoc Igorots, the Ilongots, the Ifugaos, the Kalingas, and both
the wild and the civilized Tingians, in the north, repeatedly
inspecting the several sub-provinces of the Mountain Province.</p>
<p>Through his generosity in making proper grounds available, public
interest in outdoor sports was greatly stimulated at Manila and at
Baguio, while his own participation in polo, baseball and golf was a
good example to Americans and Filipinos alike, in a country where
vigorous outdoor exercise is very necessary to the physical development
of the young and the preservation of the health of the mature. He was a
true friend of the Filipinos, whom he genuinely liked and was always
ready to assist. His personal influence was a powerful factor in the
success of the very important work carried on at the Philippine Normal
School and the Philippine Training School for Nurses.</p>
<p>During his term of office the prosperity of the islands increased by
leaps and bounds, public order became better than ever before in their
history, and the efficiency of the civil service reached its maximum.
No other governor-general ever drew so heavily on his private means in
promoting the public good, and it was the irony of fate that he should
have been accused, by certain irresponsible anti-imperialists, of using
his public office to promote his private interests. Near the end of his
administration grossly and absurdly false charges were made against him
on the floor of the House by Representative William A. Jones. As their
falsity has been conclusively and finally shown,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9518src" href="#xd26e9518" name="xd26e9518src">24</a> I will not
here lend importance to them by repeating them. No official
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>has ever given any country a cleaner
administration than Governor-General Forbes gave the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was his fortune to be in office at the time of the change in the
national administration of the United States. After continuing to serve
for months with no sign from Washington as to whether his resignation
was desired, he was advised by the Chief of the bureau of insular
affairs that the appointment of Mr. Francis Burton Harrison, who is a
Tammany Hall democrat, as his successor had been sent to the
Senate,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9525src" href="#xd26e9525" name=
"xd26e9525src">25</a> and three days after its confirmation received a
curt request for his resignation to be effected in a week and a day. He
was also requested to employ servants for Mr. Harrison. Spaniards who
read on the public streets newspapers which printed this message were
seen to tear them up and stamp on the pieces! Our Spanish friends are
accustomed to expect courtesy in connection with the removal of
faithful and efficient public servants.</p>
<p>All other governors-general had taken the oath of office at Manila.
Mr. Harrison took it at Washington on September 2, 1913. He is the
first American governor of the islands who has entered upon his high
duties without previous experience in the country which he is to
govern, and he has as yet displayed little inclination to profit by the
experience of either Filipino or American administrative insular
officials of high rank. It is too soon to discuss any feature of his
administration other than his attitude toward the civil service, which
I take up elsewhere,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9530src" href=
"#xd26e9530" name="xd26e9530src">26</a> and I can only express the hope
that when he has gained that knowledge which can come only through
personal observation on the ground, he will grow to be a wise, strong,
conservative official.</p>
<p>The establishment of civil government in the Philippine Islands
under American rule was a gradual evolution up to the time of the
assumption of control by Governor-General Harrison. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span></p>
<p>I will not attempt to follow in detail all of its successive stages,
but in closing this chapter will endeavour briefly to summarize the
results obtained up to that time.</p>
<p>The Philippines now have two delegates to the Congress of the United
States appointed by the legislature in accordance with the provision of
Section 8 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902. Both are
Filipinos.</p>
<p>The ranking executive officials of the insular government are a
governor-general, a secretary of the interior, a secretary of finance
and justice, a secretary of commerce and police and a secretary of
public instruction. All of these officers are appointed by the
President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. The secretary of
finance and justice is a Filipino; the other secretaries of departments
are Americans.</p>
<p>There is a legislature composed of two houses known respectively as
the Philippine Commission and the Philippine Assembly. The Philippine
Commission is composed of nine members; five are the governor-general
and the four secretaries of department <i>ex officio</i>, and four are
appointed by the President subject to confirmation by the Senate. Four
of the members are Filipinos and five are Americans.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e9547src" href="#xd26e9547" name="xd26e9547src">27</a></p>
<p>The Philippine Assembly is composed of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9552" title="Source: eight">eighty</span>-one elected members,
all of whom are Filipinos. They represent thirty-four of the
thirty-nine provinces into which the archipelago is divided. The two
houses of the legislature have equal powers. Neither has any special
privilege in the matter of initiating legislation, and affirmative
action by both is required in order to pass it. The Moro Province, the
Mountain Province and the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Agusan are not
represented in the assembly, nor are they subject to the jurisdiction
of the Philippine Legislature. The Philippine Commission alone has
legislative jurisdiction over them, their population being largely
composed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>of Moros, or members of other non-Christian
tribes.</p>
<p>The provinces may be divided into regularly organized provinces
governed under the provincial government act, and specially organized
provinces, which include the Moro Province, the Mountain Province and
the provinces of Mindoro, Palawan, Agusan and Nueva Vizcaya, of which
the first is governed under a special law and the remaining four are
governed under a different one known as &ldquo;The Special Provincial
Government Act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regularly organized provinces have a governor and a treasurer. The
governor is elected, and the treasurer is appointed by the
governor-general with the approval of the commission. These two
officials, with another known as the third member, constitute a
provincial board. The third member is elected. As the Filipinos usually
elect to office men from among their own people, practically all of the
elective provincial officers are Filipinos, as are ten of the
appointive officers, it having been the policy to appoint Filipinos
whenever possible.</p>
<p>Regularly organized provinces are divided into municipalities which
elect their own officers and control their own affairs for the most
part. Provincial treasurers have intervention in municipal
expenditures, which are approved in advance for each fiscal year, and
municipal officers may be removed for misconduct by the
governor-general.</p>
<p>All officers of the six special government provinces are appointed
by the governor-general with the approval of the commission.</p>
<p>There are four regularly organized municipalities in these
provinces, but the remainder of their territory is divided into
townships, which elect their own officers, except their
secretary-treasurers, who are appointed by the provincial governor; and
into <i>rancherias</i> or settlements, with all of their officials
appointed by the provincial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href=
"#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>governor. This latter form of
local government is confined to the more primitive wild people.</p>
<p>The judiciary is independent. The details of its organization will
be found in <a href="#ch15">Chapter XV</a>.</p>
<p>Three of the seven justices of the supreme court, including the
chief justice, are Filipinos, as are approximately half of the judges
of the courts of first instance and practically all justices of the
peace.</p>
<p>At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, 71 per cent of
the employees in the classified civil service of the islands were
Filipinos painstakingly trained for the positions to which they had
been appointed.</p>
<p>Prior to the American occupation, the Filipinos had practically no
intervention in the government of their country.</p>
<p>The changes introduced in the twelve years since the establishment
of civil government began are of a sweeping and radical nature. For
reasons hereinafter fully set forth, I believe they have been somewhat
too sweeping, and too radical. At all events, it is now certainly the
part of wisdom carefully to analyze their results before going
further.</p>
<p>I deem the subject of the establishment of civil governmental
control over the non-Christian tribes of the Philippines worthy of
special consideration.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9588src" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Philippine Civil Service</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before the Philippine Commission left Washington, a
clear understanding was reached with the President and secretary of war
to the effect that no political appointee whatsoever should under any
circumstances be forced upon us. After arrival at Manila early
attention was given to the drafting of a civil service act by Mr. Taft,
who was fortunate in having the assistance of Mr. Frank M. Kiggins,
chief of the examining division of the United States Civil Service
Commission. The passage of this act and its strict enforcement led to
very favourable comment in the United States. In his first annual
message President Roosevelt said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is important to have this system obtain at
home, but it is even more important to have it rigidly applied in our
insular possessions&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The merit system is simply one method of securing honest and
efficient administration of the government, and in the long run the
sole justification of any type of government lies in its proving itself
both honest and efficient.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secretary Root also gave us his fullest support, calling attention
to the fact that the law which we had passed was of a very advanced
type, and that under such circumstances as confronted us, the securing
of the best men available should outweigh, and indeed practically
exclude, all other considerations.</p>
<p>Our action met with the unqualified approval of organizations which
especially interest themselves in the maintenance of clean and
efficient public service, such as the Cambridge (Massachusetts) Civil
Service Reform <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>Association<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9611src"
href="#xd26e9611" name="xd26e9611src">1</a> and the National Civil
Service Reform League, whose committee on civil service in dependencies
spoke in very high terms of existing conditions in the
Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9614src" href="#xd26e9614"

Household Industries, where Filipina women are taught useful and
profitable employments.</p>
</div>
<p>In its first annual report the Civil Service Board called attention
to some of the more important provisions of the Act in the following
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Competitive examinations must, whenever
practicable, be held for original entrance to the service, and
promotions of employees must also be based upon competitive
examinations, in which the previous experience and efficiency of
employees shall be given due consideration. The examinations for
entrance to the service must be held in the United States and in the
Philippine Islands, and applicants are required to be tested in both
English and Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disloyalty to the United States of America as the supreme
authority in the Islands is made a complete disqualification for
holding office, and every applicant for admission to the service must,
before being admitted to examination, take the oath of loyalty. By an
amendment to the Civil Service Act on January 26, 1901, it is further
declared that all persons in arms against the authority of the United
States in the Philippine Islands, and all persons aiding or abetting
them, on the first day of April, 1901, shall be ineligible to hold
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minimum age limit of eighteen years and a maximum age limit
of forty years are fixed for those who enter the lowest grades in the
service. This avoids the difficulty and embarrassment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>that
would result from the admission of men advanced in years to positions
where the duties can be better performed by younger and more energetic
persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board is given authority to investigate matters relative
to the enforcement of the act and the rules, and is empowered to
administer oaths, to summon witnesses, and to require the production of
office books and records in making such investigations. Without such a
provision it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to conduct
satisfactory investigations, but with the authority conferred by the
act, the Board can make a rigid inquiry into the facts of every case
arising under the act and the rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The act provides for the ultimate classification of all
positions in the service, from laborers to heads of bureaus and
offices, and the Board may, in its discretion, determine the efficiency
of those now in the service as well as those who may enter hereafter
through its examinations. This authority will enable the Board to
ascertain the fitness of all employees so that only the most competent
will be retained in the service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a check upon the illegal payment of salaries the act
provides that whenever the Board finds that a person has been appointed
in violation of its provisions or of the rules of the Board, and so
certifies to the disbursing and auditing officers, such payments shall
be illegal, and if payment is continued the disbursing officer shall
not receive credit for the same and the auditing officer who authorizes
the payment shall be liable on his official bond for the loss to the
government.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In its third annual report the Civil Service Board mentioned the
following among its distinctive duties:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;All appointments to classified positions are
required to be made on a form prescribed by the Board, and the
Board&rsquo;s attestation is required in each case before the Civil
Governor or Secretary of Department will approve the appointment and
before the disbursing officer will pay any salary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The papers in all cases of reduction, removal and enforced
resignation are required to be submitted to the Board for
recommendation before transmission to the Civil Governor or Secretary
of Department for final action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board is required to keep a record of all unclassified as
well as classified employees in the Philippine civil service, showing
among other things date of appointment, original position and salary,
place of employment, all changes in status and grade, and all accrued
and sick leave granted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href=
"#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;From its service records the Board is required to compile
annually, for publication on January 1, a roster of the officers and
employees under the Philippine Government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Applications from employees, classified and unclassified, for
accrued and sick leave for more than two days must be made on a form
prescribed by the Board and forwarded to it for verification of service
record and previous leave granted and for recommendation before final
action is taken by the Civil Governor or Secretary of
Department.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These extracts from official reports clearly show that the act was
indeed of a very advanced type, and if honestly enforced would of
necessity lead to the establishment and maintenance of &ldquo;an
efficient and honest civil service,&rdquo; for which purpose it was
enacted.</p>
<p>In 1905 the insular government dispensed with boards as
administrative agencies, and in accordance with this general policy, a
bureau of civil service with a director at its head was substituted for
the Civil Service Board, thus securing greater administrative
efficiency and increased economy.</p>
<p>At first the Civil Service Act applied to comparatively few
positions, as only a few bureaus and offices had been created, but as
the government was organized and grew, the different bureaus and
offices were placed in the classified service, the acts organizing them
leaving in the unclassified service positions to which in the judgment
of the commission the examination requirements of the act should not
apply. Ultimately these requirements were made applicable to the
treasurers of all municipalities and to all positions, including
teachers, in the executive and judicial branches of the central
government, the provincial governments, and the governments of the
cities of Manila and Baguio, except a few specifically excepted by law,
which for the most part are unclassified or exempt in almost all
governments, national, state and municipal, having civil service laws.
None of the states of the Union has such a widely extended
classification of its civil service. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the exception of the positions specifically placed in the
unclassified service by law and of appointments made by the Philippine
Commission, all positions in the Philippine civil service are
classified and must be filled by appointees who have passed civil
service examinations. Neither the governor-general nor the Bureau of
Civil Service can, by the promulgation of civil service rules, or in
any other manner whatever, transfer any position from the classified to
the unclassified service or except from examination any position in the
classified service. Under most of the civil service laws of the United
States the President or the governor of the state has authority to
transfer positions from the non-classified or exempted class to the
competitive classified civil service or <i>vice versa</i>, these powers
sometimes leading to manipulation of the civil service rules for
political purposes.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, where emergencies, such as cholera epidemics,
sometimes lead to the employment of large bodies of temporary employees
without examination, when the emergency has passed the temporary
employees have always been discharged; and no employee has ever
received classification without examination on account of temporary
service. This is in marked contrast to the practice in the United
States, where large bodies of employees taken on for temporary service
due to emergencies, such as the war with Spain, are not infrequently
blanketed into the classified service without examination.</p>
<p>In its last annual report the board recommended that a number of
official positions in the unclassified service be placed in the
classified service, and gave as a reason therefor that such action
would &ldquo;add to the attractiveness of the classified service by
increasing the opportunities therein for promotion to responsible
positions.&rdquo; This recommendation was adopted by providing that all
vacancies in the positions of heads and assistant heads of bureaus or
offices and of superintendents shall be filled by promotion, with or
without examination, in the discretion <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>of the civil governor
or proper head of a department, of persons in the classified civil
service, if competent persons are found therein.</p>
<p>This provision is an important and distinguishing feature of the
Philippine Civil Service Act. The federal civil service has none
comparable with it. It is of special value in that it induces young men
of exceptional ability and training to enter the lower grades, for they
have the certainty that faithful and efficient work will in the end
earn for them the highest positions.</p>
<p>On February 25, 1909, the director of civil service made the
following statement with respect to the observance of the
law:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A careful study of Act 5 and all acts
amendatory thereof will show that there has been no change in the
policy adopted by the Commission at the outset to extend the classified
service as widely as possible and to fill by promotion all the higher
positions so far as practicable. The provision requiring the higher
positions to be filled by promotion so far as practicable has always
been regarded by the Philippine Commission, by this Bureau, and by
others interested in obtaining the best possible government service in
the Philippines as one of the most important provisions of the Civil
Service Act. It has been faithfully observed by all
Governors-General&#8202;&hellip;.With the exception of the positions of
Governor-General and Secretaries of Departments, the Philippine Civil
Service Act requires the highest positions in the executive civil
service, namely, chiefs and assistant chiefs of Bureaus and Offices, to
be filled by promotion from the entire service in all cases except when
in the opinion of the appointing power there is no person competent and
available who possesses the qualifications required, and this provision
has been faithfully observed heretofore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enforcement of the law by the commission has received the
following commendation from the executive committee of the National
Civil Service Reform League:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We have further to note with satisfaction the
course of the Philippine Commission, by which, if it be persevered in,
the merit system will be established in the Islands of that archipelago
at least as thoroughly and consistently as in any department
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>of government, Federal, State, or Municipal, in
the Union. This must be, in any case, regarded as a gratifying
recognition of sound principles of administration on the part of the
Commission, and justifies the hope that, within the limits of their
jurisdiction at least, no repetition of the scandals of post-bellum
days will be tolerated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up to the time of the appointment of Governor-General Harrison the
provisions of the Civil Service Act and rules were firmly supported by
all of the governors-general and secretaries of departments, and the
annual reports of the governor-general uniformly expressed satisfaction
with their practical operation. Mr. Taft was always an enthusiastic
supporter of the merit system.</p>
<p>Governor-General Forbes in his inaugural address made the following
statements:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is necessary that the civil service should
be rigidly maintained and its rules carefully observed. One very
distinguished Filipino has recently been appointed to administrative
control of one of the most important departments of the Government,
equal in rank to any executive position in the Islands with the
exception of the Executive head. In the executive branch of the
Government, the Filipinization of the service must steadily continue.
As vacancies occur Filipinos will be gradually substituted for
Americans as rapidly as can be done without positive detriment to the
service. At the same time, care will be taken to provide a suitable
career for honest and capable Americans who have come out here in good
faith. They should know that during good behavior and efficient
performance of their duty they are secure in their positions, and that
when they desire to return to the United States an effort will be made
to place them in the civil service at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want no better men than the present officers and employees
of the Government, Americans and Filipinos. They compare favorably with
any set of men I have ever seen both as regards ability and fidelity to
duty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the operation of the Civil Service Act the proportion of
Filipinos employed has increased from 49 per cent, in 1903, to 71 per
cent in 1913, as is shown by the following table:&mdash; <span class=

<p>For the first few years after the establishment of the government
large numbers of Americans were appointed, as there were comparatively
few Filipino candidates with the necessary educational qualifications.
During the last two years, 89 per cent of the persons appointed in the
islands have been Filipinos.</p>
<p>There has been a great increase in the number of Filipinos entering
the civil service examinations in English. Ten years ago 97 per cent of
those examined took their examinations in Spanish, while during last
year 89 per cent of those examined took examinations in English, the
total number so examined being 7755. Almost all appointees for ordinary
clerical work are now Filipinos, but the supply of bookkeepers,
stenographers, civil engineers, physicians, veterinarians, surveyors,
chemists, bacteriologists, agriculturists, horticulturists,
constabulary officers, nurses, electricians, mechanical engineers, and
other scientific employees is still insufficient to meet the demands of
the service. Only one Filipino has passed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>the stenographer
examination in English since the organization of the government, and it
is necessary each year to bring many American stenographers from the
United States. A few Filipinos pass each year the junior stenographer
examination<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9807src" href="#xd26e9807" name=
"xd26e9807src">4</a> and are able to fill some of the positions which
would formerly have required the appointment of Americans.</p>
<p>The salaries paid to executive officials, chiefs of bureaus and
offices, chief clerks, and chiefs of divisions equal in many instances
those paid to officials occupying similar positions in the service of
the United States government.</p>
<p>In the legislative branch the speaker receives $8000 per annum.
Members of the Philippine Commission without portfolios receive $7500
per annum. Members of the Philippine Assembly receive $15 a day for
each day in which the assembly is in session.</p>
<p>In the executive branch secretaries of departments receive $15,500
per annum each, including $5000 received by them as members of the
Philippine Commission. The executive secretary receives $9000 per
annum. The salaries of other bureau chiefs range from $2500 per annum
to $7500.</p>
<p>The justices of the Philippine Supreme Court receive $10,000 per
annum. Judges of courts of first instance receive from $4500 to
$5500.</p>
<p>The following extracts from an article by the chairman of the
Philippine Civil Service Board give information with respect to
salaries in the Philippine Islands, as compared with salaries paid in
surrounding British and Dutch colonies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The salaries paid officials in all branches of
the service of the Straits Settlements are generally lower than those
paid in the Philippine civil service. In this connection, however, it
is only just to state that the population and extent of the territory
under British control, and the expenses of living, are less than in the
Philippines, while the difficulty of the problems <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>to
be solved is not so great. The salaries paid to natives who fill the
lower grade positions in the civil service of the Philippine Islands
are three and four times as great as the salaries paid to natives in
similar classes of work in the civil service of the British Malay
colonies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A study of the colonial civil service of the Dutch in the
islands of Java and Madura gives us somewhat different
results&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter of salaries is peculiarly interesting. The
comparison made above of the compensations received by the high
officials in the civil service of the English colonies and by those in
the Philippines does not hold good when applied to the Dutch in Java.
In fact, the salary of the Governor-General of Java is somewhat
remarkable in contrast with that of the Civil Governor of the
Philippines. As is well known, the latter receives $20,000, while the
salary of the Governor-General of Java amounts to 132,000 gulden or
something over $53,000. The American official is given, in addition,
free transportation on all official investigations and free use of the
governor&rsquo;s palace, but not the cost of maintenance. On the other
hand, the Dutch governor is granted 51,000 gulden (about $21,500) as
personal and household expenses and travel pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general secretary of the government receives 24,000
gulden ($9648), as compared with the executive secretary of the
Philippine government, whose salary is $7500.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9831src" href="#xd26e9831" name="xd26e9831src">5</a> The seven
heads of departments in the Javanese service each receive a like
compensation of 24000 gulden. The Raad, or Council, of the Dutch
colonial government is composed of a vice-president and four
members&mdash;the former receiving about $14,500, the latter slightly
over $11,500 each. In the Philippine government the executive functions
of heads of departments are exercised by four members of the
legislative body, each of whom receives $10,500 for his executive
services and $5000 for his legislative duties. Without going further
into detail, the conclusion is evident that all officials of high rank
are much better paid in the Dutch service. When a comparison is made
between the chief clerks and other office employees of middle
grades&mdash;not natives&mdash;the salaries are seen to be about the
same in the two countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All natives in positions of lower grades, however, in the
Philippine Islands fare better than their Malay brethren, either in the
Straits Settlements or in the East Indies.&rdquo;&mdash;(Second Annual
Report of the Philippine Civil Service Board, pp. 60, 61.) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Difference in salaries for subordinate positions in the
British and Dutch colonial services and the Philippine service are
distinctly in favour of subordinate employees in the Philippine
service; only the higher officials, after long experience, in the
British colonial service receive larger salaries than corresponding
officials in the Philippine service; the leave of absence and other
privileges for the Philippine service are not less liberal than for
other colonial services.&rdquo;&mdash;(Report of the Philippine
Commission for 1905, p. 74.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entrance salaries of Americans brought to the islands are
considerably in excess of the entrance salaries received on appointment
to the civil service in the United States.</p>

<p>The following cases taken from the official rosters show some
promotions to the higher positions in the service of employees who
entered the lower ranks of the classified service:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span></p>
<p>A clerk who entered the service in 1899 at $1800 per annum was
appointed in 1903 an assistant chief of bureau at $3000 per annum and
in 1908 executive secretary at $9000 per annum. A teacher appointed in
1899 at $720 per annum was appointed a chief of an office at $4000 per
annum and in 1912 a judge at $4500 per annum. A teacher who entered the
service in 1901 at $1200 per annum was in 1909 appointed a chief of a
bureau at $6000 per annum. A teacher who entered the service in 1904 at
$1000 per annum was appointed in 1911 an assistant chief of a bureau at
$6000 per annum. A clerk who entered the service in 1901 at $1200 per
annum was appointed in 1909 an assistant chief of the executive bureau
at $3750 per annum and in 1912 a chief of a bureau at $6000 per annum.
A stenographer who entered the service in 1902 at $1400 per annum was
in 1908 appointed an assistant chief of a bureau at $5000 per annum. A
transitman who entered the service in 1905 at $1400 per annum was in
1913 appointed an assistant chief of a bureau at $4500 per annum. An
accountant who entered the service in 1901 at $1800 per annum was in
1907 appointed an assistant chief of a bureau at $3750 per annum and in
1909 a chief of a bureau at $6000 per annum. A law clerk who entered
the service in 1904 at $1800 per annum was in 1913 appointed judge at
$4500 per annum. In no service anywhere has promotion depended more
directly on demonstrated ability, and in many instances it has been
rapid.</p>
<p>Young men living two in a room may obtain room and board in boarding
houses in Manila at a rate as low as $35 per month each. In the Young
Men&rsquo;s Christian Association building, a large re&euml;nforced
concrete structure with reading room, gymnasium, and a good restaurant,
the charge for two in a room is $10.25 each. Board costs $27.50, a
total of $37.75. The expenses for clothing in Manila are less than in
the United States, as white clothing is worn the whole year and white
duck suits may be obtained for about $3 each. The expenses for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>laundry amount to about $5 a month. The
necessity of employing a <i>muchacho</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9943src" href="#xd26e9943" name="xd26e9943src">6</a> is
<i>nil</i>, in the case of an unmarried employee who boards. Servants
are far cheaper and better in the Philippines than in the United
States.</p>
<p>In a discussion of the salaries paid in the Philippine civil service
the question of the leave allowed should be considered. Classified
employees who receive an annual salary of $1000 or more per annum may
be granted twenty-eight days&rsquo; leave per annum to cover absences
from duty due to illness or other causes. If not taken during the
calendar year in which it is earned or in January or February of the
succeeding year, it is forfeited. Employees taking vacation leave
during the months of December, January, February and March may take
fifty-six days, corresponding to two years of service, at one time, and
may thus get time to visit Australia, Japan, China, and neighbouring
countries.</p>
<p>In addition to vacation leave an employee whose salary is $1000 or
more but less than $1800 per annum is entitled to thirty days&rsquo;
accrued leave per annum, and an employee whose salary is $1800 per
annum or more is entitled to thirty-five days&rsquo; accrued leave per
annum. Accrued leave may accumulate for not more than five years of
service.</p>
<p>All classified employees are entitled to visit the United States or
foreign countries once in every three years, receiving in addition to
their accrued leave, one year&rsquo;s vacation leave, allowance of
actual travel time at half pay not to exceed sixty days, and return
travel expenses from place of residence in the United States, or from
port of embarkation in a foreign country to Manila, on the completion
of two years of service after date of return. An employee entitled to
thirty-five days&rsquo; accrued leave per annum who visits the United
States after having rendered three years of service receives a total of
two hundred thirteen days&rsquo; accrued leave, vacation leave, and
half-pay travel time. If he postpones his visit till he has completed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>five years of service, he receives a total of
two hundred ninety-one days&rsquo; accrued leave, vacation leave and
travel time. An employee entitled to thirty days&rsquo; accrued leave
per annum who visits the United States after three years of service
receives a total of one hundred ninety-four days&rsquo; leave and
half-pay travel time, and if he postpones his visit until he has
rendered five years of service, he receives a total of two hundred
fifty-nine days&rsquo; leave and travel time.</p>
<p>It will be seen that these are very liberal allowances. An employee
receiving $1200 at the end of two years of service may spend eight
weeks of vacation leave visiting Japan or other surrounding countries,
and at the end of an additional year&rsquo;s service he may visit his
home in the United States with six and a third months&rsquo; absence on
full and half pay and with his expenses from his home to Manila payable
two years after his return, and during every three years of his service
he may have the same privileges.</p>
<p>The law also provides that if an employee is wounded or injured in
the performance of duty, he may have a total of six months&rsquo; leave
on full pay in addition to any accrued leave to his credit.</p>
<p>Employees who have rendered satisfactory service and resign after
three or more years receive in a lump sum all accrued leave due and
thirty days&rsquo; half salary. For example, an employee who has
received $1800 per annum and has served five years without taking any
leave in excess of the four weeks&rsquo; vacation leave allowable
annually would draw $1025 were he to resign.</p>
<p>The school sessions amount to forty weeks per annum and the school
vacations to twelve weeks per annum.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9965src" href="#xd26e9965" name="xd26e9965src">7</a> Teachers
receive an annual salary and draw full pay during vacations as well as
during school sessions. Every third year they are allowed to visit the
United States or foreign countries with an allowance of sixty
days&rsquo; half-pay travel time in addition to the ten weeks&rsquo;
long vacation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>and on completing two years of service after
return to the islands they are entitled to their travelling expenses
from place of residence in the United States to Manila or from port of
embarkation in a foreign country to Manila.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare these provisions with the regulations
governing leave of absence in the British colonial service:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">(1) There is no distinction between sick leave and
ordinary leave, the leave of absence on account of sickness being
charged against the ordinary leave allowable.</p>
<p>(2) There are two classes of leave: vacation leave on full pay and
half-pay leave.</p>
<p>(3) The vacation leave amounts to three months every two years, and
must be taken during the two years, as it does not accumulate.</p>
<p>(4) The half-pay leave amounts to two months for each year of
service, but cannot be taken until after a period of six years&rsquo;
resident service in the Colony, except in cases of serious
indisposition supported by medical certificate, or of &ldquo;urgent
private affairs,&rdquo; the nature of which must be stated to the
governor. In either case, the governor and council must be satisfied
that the indulgence is indispensable.</p>
<p>Half pay in African and Asiatic colonies may accumulate for twelve
years&rsquo; service&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> twenty-four months&rsquo;
half-pay leave.</p>
<p>(5) After the exhaustion of all vacation leave and half-pay leave,
an advance of six months&rsquo; half-pay leave may be made on special
grounds (&ldquo;urgent private affairs&rdquo; or illness supported by a
medical certificate), the advance being charged against leave accruing
subsequently.</p>
<p>(6) For the purpose of visiting home, an officer may be granted the
vacation leave due him (which is never more than three months) on full
pay, and his accumulated half-pay leave, to commence at the expiration
of his vacation leave.</p>
<p>(7) Judicial and education officers do not receive the vacation
leave described in paragraph 3 above, the vacation of courts and
schools being considered equal to this, but they do receive the
half-pay leave described in paragraph 4, and may, when visiting home on
half-pay leave, receive full pay during any ordinary vacation of the
court or school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that although officers in the British colonial
service are allowed much longer periods of absence, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>the
greater part of their absence is on half pay and the total money value
of the leave allowable in the British colonial service and in the
Philippine civil service is about the same. As officers naturally
prefer to be on full pay instead of half pay while on leave, the
provision of the Philippine law is in their interest; it is also in the
interest of the service, as the periods of the absence from duty are
not so prolonged.</p>
<p>The Philippine Civil Service Law is now about to be put to its first
really severe test as a result of the change in the national
administration. Heretofore those whose duty and privilege it has been
to enforce it have been in the most full and hearty sympathy with its
purposes. President McKinley was from the outset definitely committed
to the widest application of the merit system to appointments in the
Philippines. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft firmly supported that system,
as has each succeeding governor-general up to, but not including, Mr.
Harrison, who is as yet an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>It is interesting, however, to note that on the day following his
arrival there was a demand for the instant resignation of Mr. Thomas
Cary Welch, a faithful and efficient employee of the government, who
had been for nearly ten years in the service, whose position was
desired for, and immediately given to, Mr. Stephen Bonsal. That
gentleman had been appointed at Washington a member of the Municipal
Board of Manila immediately after Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s confirmation as
governor-general. It is not recorded that Mr. Bonsal rendered any
valuable service to the city on the voyage, or during the twenty-four
hours of his occupancy of his municipal post subsequent to his arrival!
Nor does it appear that he passed any examination before his early
promotion.</p>
<p>Following closely upon the removal of Mr. Welch came a demand for
the resignation of Captain Charles H. Sleeper, Director of Lands, who
was unquestionably one of the ablest and most efficient of the bureau
chiefs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span></p>
<p>He had earned the ill-will of the <i>politicos</i> by insisting that
persons authorized to make public land surveys, or other surveys on
which claims of title as against the government were to be based,
should know enough about surveying to make one correct survey when
given an opportunity practically to demonstrate their abilities under
very favourable conditions. He had also incurred the dislike of
influential <i>caciques</i> by defending the occupants of small
holdings on friar estates from the rapacity of their rich neighbours,
and by protecting free-patent applicants and homesteaders when large
landowners opposed their applications in order to prevent their
securing land, so that they might the more easily be held as peon
labourers.</p>
<p>He had started in his bureau a practical school for Filipino
surveyors which was training really well-qualified candidates for
positions desired by the politicians for themselves or their
incompetent friends.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, he had helped to upset the plans of the men
primarily responsible for the so-called &ldquo;friar lands
investigation&rdquo; conducted by the House Committee on Insular
Affairs, which cost the United States government a very large sum, and
resulted in demonstrating his uprightness and the efficiency of his
administration.</p>
<p>Mr. John R. Wilson, the assistant director of lands, was absent at
the moment, but his resignation was demanded on the day of his return.
He too was an active, efficient, upright man.</p>
<p>Both of these removals were political acts, pure and simple. Sr.
Manuel Tinio was appointed Director of Lands. He is a bright young
Ilocano of good character, who had become a &ldquo;general&rdquo; in
the Insurgent army at twenty-one years of age. He is unfit to hold the
place, because, as he has himself frankly said, he knows nothing about
the work. He is charged with the duty of administering $7,000,000 worth
of friar lands, and the whole public domain of the Philippine Islands,
and with such minor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377"
name="pb377">377</a>]</span>duties as the checkmating of the
machinations of numerous wealthy Filipinos who seek fraudulently to
acquire great tracts through fraudulent claims to unperfected titles
and by other improper means.</p>
<p>While in Honolulu, <i>en route</i> to Manila, Mr. Harrison gave out
an interview, which I am credibly informed he has since confirmed in
substance. It contained the following statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;For years I have been of the minority in
Congress and have seen the Democrats kicked about, trampled upon, and
otherwise manhandled by Republicans, so that I must confess it now
gives me a saturnine pleasure to see the Democrats in a position to do
the same thing to the Republicans.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His early official acts after arrival at Manila confirmed the belief
that this was indeed the spirit in which he was facing the grave
responsibilities which there confronted him.</p>
<p>It is beyond doubt or cavil that high ideals heretofore have
prevailed in the Philippine Civil Service. Are they now to be
substituted by the methods of the ward politician?</p>
<p>In its report for 1901 the Philippine Commission said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The civil service law has been in operation
since our last report, and we see no reason to change our conclusion as
to the absolute necessity for its existence, and strict enforcement.
Without this law American government in these Islands is, in our
opinion, foredoomed to humiliating failure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I signed that report. I have not since seen any reason to change my
mind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Philippine Constabulary and Public Order</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the last thirty years of Spanish rule in the
Philippines evil-doers were pursued and apprehended and public order
was maintained chiefly by the <i lang="es">guardia civil</i>. At the
time of its organization in 1868 this body had a single division. By
1880 the number had been increased to three, two for Luz&oacute;n and
one for the Visayan Islands.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> was organized upon a military
basis, its officers and soldiers being drawn from the regular army of
Spain by selection or upon recommendation. Detachments were distributed
throughout the provinces and were commanded according to their size by
commissioned or non-commissioned officers. Central offices were located
in district capitals; company headquarters were stationed in provincial
capitals, and detachments were sent to places where they were deemed to
be necessary.</p>
<p>Under ordinary conditions they rendered service as patrols of two
men each, but for the purpose of attacking large bands of outlaws one
or several companies were employed as occasion required.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> had jurisdiction over all sorts
of violations of laws and municipal ordinances. They made reports upon
which were based the appointments of municipal officers, the granting
of licenses to carry firearms, and the determination of the loyalty or
the disloyalty of individuals.</p>
<p>They were vested with extraordinary powers. Offences against them
were tried by courts-martial, and were construed as offences against
sentinels on duty. Penalties were therefore extremely severe.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>Officers of the <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> on leave could by
their own initiative assume a status of duty with the full powers and
responsibilities that go with command. This is contrary to American
practice, under which only dire emergency justifies an officer in
assuming an official status unless he is duly assigned thereto by
competent authority.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> could arrest on suspicion, and
while the Spanish Government did not directly authorize or sanction the
use of force to extort confessions, it was not scrupulous in the matter
of accepting confessions so obtained as evidence of crime, nor was it
quick to punish members of the <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> charged
with mistreatment of prisoners.</p>
<p>Reports made by the <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> were not
questioned, but were accepted without support even in cases of the
killing of prisoners alleged to have attempted to escape, or of men
evading arrest.</p>
<p>This method of eliminating without trial citizens deemed to be
undesirable was applied with especial frequency in the suppression of
active brigandage, and latterly during the revolution against Spain.
Prisoners in charge of the <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> were always
tied elbow to elbow. They knew full well that resistance or flight was
an invitation to their guards to kill them, and that this invitation
was likely to be promptly accepted.</p>
<p>In the investigation of crime the members of this organization
arrested persons on suspicion and compelled them to make revelations,
true or false. Eye-witnesses to the commission of crime were not needed
in the Spanish courts of that day. The confession of an accused person
secured his conviction, even though not made in the presence of a
judge. Indirect and hearsay evidence were accepted, and such things as
writs of habeas corpus and the plea of double jeopardy were unknown in
Spanish procedure.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> could rearrest individuals and
again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>charge them with crimes of which they had
already been acquitted. I have been assured by reliable Filipino
witnesses that it was common during the latter days of Spanish
sovereignty for persons who had made themselves obnoxious to the
government to be invited by non-commissioned officers to take a walk,
which was followed either by their complete disappearance or by the
subsequent discovery of their dead bodies.</p>
<p>It naturally resulted that the members of the <i lang="es">guardia
civil</i> were regarded with detestation and terror by the people, but
their power was so absolute that protest rarely became public. The one
notable exception was furnished by Dr. Rizal&rsquo;s book entitled
&ldquo;Noli Me Tangere,&rdquo; which voiced the complaints of the
Filipinos against them. There is not a vestige of doubt that hatred of
them was one of the principal causes of the insurrection against
Spain.</p>
<p>In 1901 the American government organized a rural police force in
the Philippines. It was called the Philippine constabulary. The
insurrection was then drawing to a close, but there were left in the
field many guerilla bands armed and uniformed. Their members sought to
excuse their lawless acts under the plea of patriotism and opposition
to the forces of the United States. In many provinces they combined
with professional bandits or with religious fanatics. Various
&ldquo;popes&rdquo; arose, like Papa Isio in Negros. The Filipinos had
become accustomed to a state of war which had continued for nearly six
years. Habits of peace had been abandoned. The once prosperous
haciendas were in ruins. War and pestilence had destroyed many of the
work animals, and those which remained continued to perish from
disease. Asiatic cholera was sweeping through the archipelago, and
consternation and disorder followed in its wake.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances the organization of a rural police force
was imperatively necessary. Unfortunately the most critical situation
which it was to be called upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381"
href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>to meet had to be faced at
the very outset, when both officers and men were inexperienced and
before adequate discipline could be established.</p>
<p>The law providing for its establishment was drawn by the Honourable
Luke E. Wright, at that time secretary of commerce and police and later
destined to become governor-general of the Philippines and secretary of
war of the United States.</p>
<p>It was intended that the constabulary should accomplish its ends by
force when necessary but by sympathetic supervision when possible,
suppressing brigandage and turning the people towards habits of peace.
The fact was clearly borne in mind that the abuses of the <i lang=
"es">guardia civil</i> had not been forgotten and the new force was
designed to meet existing conditions, to allay as rapidly as possible
the existing just rancour against the similar organization established
under the Spanish r&eacute;gime, and to avoid the evils which had
contributed so much toward causing the downfall of Spanish sovereignty.
The law was admirably framed to achieve these ends.</p>
<p>The officers of the constabulary were selected chiefly from American
volunteers recently mustered out and from honourably discharged
soldiers of the United States army. Some few Filipinos, whose loyalty
was above suspicion, were appointed to the lower grades. This number
has since been materially augumented, and some of the original Filipino
appointees have risen to the rank of captain.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that at the outset there should be abuses. The
organization was necessarily born at work; there was no time to
instruct, to formulate regulations, to wait until a satisfactory state
of discipline had been brought about. There were not barracks for
housing the soldiers; there were neither uniforms, nor arms, nor
ammunition. There was no system for rationing the men. All of these
things had to be provided, and they were provided through a natural
evolution of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>practical processes, crystallizing into form,
tested by the duties of the day. The organization which grew up was a
true survival of the fittest, both in personnel and in methods. The
wonder is not that some abuses occurred, but that they were so few; not
that there were occasional evidences of lack of efficiency, but that
efficiency was on the whole so high from the beginning.</p>
<p>The several provinces were made administrative units, the commanding
officer in each being designated as &ldquo;senior inspector.&rdquo; The
men who were to serve in a given province were by preference recruited
there, and a departure was thus made from the usual foreign colonial
practice.</p>
<p>In 1905 the total force was fixed at one hundred companies with a
nominal strength of two officers and fifty men each. Under special
conditions this rule may be departed from, and the size of the
companies or the number of officers increased.</p>
<p>Each province is divided by the senior inspector into sections, and
the responsibility for patrol work and general policing rests on the
senior company officer in each station. The provinces are grouped into
five districts, each commanded by an assistant chief who exercises
therein the authority, and performs the duties appropriate to the chief
for the entire Philippines. The higher administrative positions have
always been filled by detailing regular officers of the United States
army.</p>
<p>The constabulary soldiers are now neatly uniformed, armed with Krag
carbines and well disciplined. They show the effect of good and regular
food and of systematic exercise, their physical condition being vastly
superior to that of the average Filipino. They are given regular
instruction in their military duties. It is conducted in English.</p>
<p>The Philippine constabulary may be defined as a body of armed men
with a military organization, recruited from among the people of the
islands, officered in part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href=
"#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>by Americans and in part by
Filipinos, and employed primarily for police duty in connection with
the establishment and maintenance of public order.</p>
<p>Blount&rsquo;s chapters on the administrations of Taft, Wright and
Smith embody one prolonged plaint to the effect that the organization
of the constabulary was premature, and that after the war proper ended,
the last smouldering embers of armed and organized insurrection should
have been stamped out, and the brigandage which had existed in the
Philippines for centuries should have been dealt with, by the United
States army rather than by the constabulary.</p>
<p>Even if it were true that the army could have rendered more
effective service to this end than could have been expected at the
outset from a newly organized body of Filipino soldiers, the argument
against the organization and use of the constabulary would in my
opinion have been by no means conclusive. It is our declared policy to
prepare the Filipinos to establish and maintain a stable government of
their own. The proper exercise of police powers is obviously necessary
to such an end.</p>
<p>From the outset we have sacrificed efficiency in order that our
wards might gain practical experience, and might demonstrate their
ability, or lack of ability, to perform necessary governmental
functions. Does any one cognizant of the situation doubt for a moment
that provincial and municipal affairs in the Philippine Islands would
to-day be more efficiently administered if provincial and municipal
officers were appointed instead of being elected? Is any one so foolish
as to imagine that the sanitary regeneration of the islands would not
have progressed much more rapidly had highly trained American health
officers been used in place of many of the badly educated and
comparatively inexperienced Filipino physicians whose services have
been utilized?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the concrete case under discussion I dissent from
the claim that more satisfactory results <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>could have been
obtained by the use of American troops.</p>
<p>The army had long been supreme in the Philippines. Every function of
government had been performed by its officers and men, if performed at
all. Our troops had been combating an elusive and cruel enemy. If they
were human it is to be presumed that they still harbored animosities,
born of these conditions, toward the people with whom they had so
recently been fighting. Had the work of pacification been then turned
over to them it would have meant that often in the localities in which
they had been fighting, and in dealing with the men to whom they had
very recently been actively opposed in armed conflict, they would have
been called upon to perform tasks and to entertain feelings radically
different from those of the preceding two or three years.</p>
<p>A detachment, marching through Leyte, found an American who had
disappeared a short time before crucified, head down. His abdominal
wall had been carefully opened so that his intestines might hang down
in his face.</p>
<p>Another American prisoner, found on the same trip, had been buried
in the ground with only his head projecting. His mouth had been propped
open with a stick, a trail of sugar laid to it through the forest, and
a handful thrown into it.</p>
<p>Millions of ants had done the rest.</p>
<p>Officers and men who saw such things were thereby fitted for war,
rather than for ordinary police duty.</p>
<p>The truth is that they had seen so many of them that they continued
to see them in imagination when they no longer existed. I well remember
when a general officer, directed by his superior to attend a banquet at
Manila in which Americans and Filipinos joined, came to it wearing a
big revolver!</p>
<p>Long after Manila was quiet I was obliged to get out of my carriage
in the rain and darkness half a dozen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb385" href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>times while driving
the length of Calle Real, and &ldquo;approach to be recognized&rdquo;
by raw &ldquo;rookies,&rdquo; each of whom pointed a loaded rifle at me
while I did it. I know that this did not tend to make me feel peaceable
or happy. In my opinion it was wholly unnecessary, and yet I did not
blame the army for thinking otherwise.</p>
<p>After the war was over, when my private secretary, Mr. James H.
LeRoy, was one day approaching Malolos, he was sternly commanded by a
sentry to halt, the command being emphasized as usual by presenting to
his attention a most unattractive view down the muzzle of a Krag. He
was next ordered to &ldquo;salute the flag,&rdquo; which he finally
discovered with difficulty in the distance, after being told where to
look. The army way is right and necessary in war, but it makes a lot of
bother in time of peace!</p>
<p>This was not the only reason for failing to make more extensive use
of American soldiers in police duty. A veteran colonel of United States
cavalry who had just read Judge Blount&rsquo;s book was asked what he
thought of the claim therein made that the army should have done the
police and pacification work of the Philippines. His reply
was:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;How long would it take a regiment of Filipinos
to catch an American outlaw in the United States?
Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another army officer said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Catching Filipino outlaws with the Army is like
catching a flea in a twenty-acre field with a traction
engine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is perhaps nothing so demoralizing to regular troops as
employment on police duty which requires them to work singly or in
small squads. Discipline speedily goes to the dogs and instruction
becomes impossible.</p>

<p>Successful prosecution of the work of chasing <i>ladrones</i> in the
Philippines requires a thorough knowledge of local topography and of
local native dialects. Spanish is of use, but only in dealing with
educated Filipinos. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>knowledge of the Filipino himself;
of his habits of thought; of his attitude toward the white man; and
toward the <i>illustrado</i>, or educated man, of his own race; ability
to enter a town and speedily to determine the relative importance of
its leading citizens, finally centring on the one man, always to be
found, who runs it, whether he holds political office or not, and also
to enlist the sympathy and co&ouml;peration of its people; all of these
things are essential to the successful handling of brigandage in the
Philippines, whether such brigandage has, or lacks, political
significance.</p>
<p>The following parallel will make clear some of the reasons why it
was determined to use constabulary instead of American soldiers in
policing the Philippines from the time the insurrection officially
ended:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before preparing the foregoing statement relative to the reasons for
using Philippine constabulary soldiers instead of soldiers of the
United States army for police work during the period in question, I
asked Colonel J. G. Harbord, assistant director of the constabulary,
who has served with that body nine years, has been its acting director
and is an officer of the United States army, to give me a memorandum on
the subject. It is only fair to him to say that I have not only
followed very closely the line of argument embodied in the memorandum
which he was good enough to prepare for me, but have in many instances
used his very words. The parallel columns are his. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span></p>
<p>The constabulary soldier, thoroughly familiar with the topography of
the country in which he operates; speaking the local dialect and
acquainted with the persons most likely to be able and willing to
furnish accurate information; familiar with the characteristics of his
own people; able to live off the country and keep well, is under all
ordinary circumstances a more efficient and vastly less expensive
police officer than the American soldier, no matter how brave and
energetic the latter may be. Furthermore, his activities are much less
likely to arouse animosity.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the army is pretty consistently unwilling to take the
field unless the constitutional guarantees are temporarily suspended,
and it particularly objects to writs of habeas corpus. The suspension
of such guarantees is obviously undesirable unless really very
necessary.</p>
<p>Let us now consider some of the specific instances of alleged
inefficiency of the constabulary in suppressing public disorder, cited
by Blount.</p>
<p>On page 403 of his book he says, speaking of Governor Taft and
disorder in the province of Albay which arose in
1902&ndash;1903:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;He did not want to order out the military again
if he could help it, and this relegated him to his native municipal
police and constabulary, experimental outfits of doubtful loyalty, and,
at best, wholly inadequate, as it afterwards turned out, for the
maintenance of public order and for affording to the peaceably inclined
people that sort of security for life and property, and that protection
against semi-political as well as unmitigated brigandage, which would
comport with the dignity of this nation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The facts as to these disorders are briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1902 an outlaw in Tayabas Province who made his living by
organizing political conspiracies and collecting contributions in the
name of patriotism, who was known as Jos&eacute; Roldan when operating
in adjoining provinces, but had an alias in Tayabas, found his life
made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>so uncomfortable by the constabulary of that
province that he transferred his operations to Albay. There he
affiliated himself with a few ex-Insurgent officers who had turned
outlaws instead of surrendering, and with oath violators, and began the
same kind of political operations which he had carried out in Tayabas,
the principal feature of his work being the collection of
&ldquo;contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troubles in Albay were encouraged by wealthy Filipinos who saw
in them a probable opportunity to acquire valuable hemp lands at bottom
prices, for people dependent on their hemp fields, if prevented from
working them, might in the end be forced to sell them. Roldan soon lost
standing with his new organization because it was found that he was
using for his personal benefit the money which he collected.</p>
<p>About this time one Simeon Ola joined his organization. Ola was a
native of Albay, where he had been an Insurgent major under the command
of the Tag&aacute;log general, Belarmino. His temporary rank had gone
to his head, and he is reported to have shown considerable severity and
hauteur in his treatment of his former neighbours in Guinobatan, to
which place he had returned at the close of the insurrection.
Meanwhile, a wealthy Chinese <i>mestizo</i> named Don Circilio Jaucian,
on whom Ola, during his brief career as an Insurgent officer, had laid
a heavy hand, had become <i>presidente</i> of the town.</p>
<p>Smarting under the indignities which he had suffered, Jaucian made
it very uncomfortable for the former major, and in ways well understood
in Malay countries brought it home to the latter that their positions
had been reversed. Ola&rsquo;s house was mysteriously burned, and his
life in Guinobatan was made so unbearable that he took to the
hills.</p>
<p>Ola had held higher military rank than had any of his outlaw
associates, and he became their dominating spirit. He had no grievance
against the Americans, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>took every opportunity to avenge
himself on the <i>caciques</i> of Guinobatan, his native town.</p>
<p>Three assistant chiefs of constabulary, Garwood, Baker and
Bandholtz, were successively sent to Albay to deal with this situation.
Baker and Bandholtz were regular army officers. The latter ended the
disturbances, employing first and last some twelve companies of
Philippine scouts, armed, officered, paid, equipped and disciplined as
are the regular soldiers of the United States army, and a similar
number of constabulary soldiers. Eleven stations in the restricted
field of operations of this outlaw were occupied by scouts. There were
few armed conflicts in force between Ola&rsquo;s men and these troops.
In fact, it was only with the greatest difficulty that this band, which
from time to time dissolved into the population only to reappear again,
could be located even by the native soldiers. It would have been
impracticable successfully to use American troops for such work.</p>
<p>Referring to the statement made by Blount<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10308src" href="#xd26e10308" name="xd26e10308src">1</a> that
Vice-Governor Wright made a visit to Albay in 1903 in the interest
&ldquo;of the peace-at-any-price policy that the Manila Government was
bent on,&rdquo; and the implication that he went there to conduct peace
negotiations, General Bandholtz, who suppressed outlawry in Albay, has
said that Vice-Governor Wright and Commissioner Pardo de Tavera came
there at his request to look into conditions with reference to certain
allegations which had been made.</p>
<p>Colonel Bandholtz and the then chief of constabulary, General Allen,
were supported by the civil governor and the commission in their
recommendations that no terms should be made with the outlaws. The
following statement occurs in a letter from General Bandholtz dated
September 21, 1903:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;No one is more anxious to terminate this
business than I am, nevertheless I think it would be a mistake to offer
any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>such inducements, and that more lasting benefits
would result by hammering away as we have been doing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And General Allen said in an indorsement to the Philippine
Commission:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&hellip; in my opinion the judgment of Colonel
Bandholtz in matters connected with the pacification of Albay should
receive favourable consideration. Halfway measures are always
misinterpreted and used to the detriment of the Government among the
ignorant followers of the outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These views prevailed.</p>
<p>Blount has claimed that the death rate in the Albay jail at this
time was very excessive, and cites it as an instance of the result of
American maladministration.</p>
<p>Assuming that his tabulation<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10331src"
href="#xd26e10331" name="xd26e10331src">2</a> of the dead who died in
the Albay jail between May 30 and September, 1903, amounting to 120, is
correct, the following statements should be made:&mdash;</p>
<p>Only recently has it been demonstrated that beri-beri is due to the
use of polished rice, which was up to the time of this discovery
regarded as far superior to unpolished rice as an article of food, and
is still much better liked by the Filipinos than is the unpolished
article. Many of these deaths were from beri-beri, and were due to a
misguided effort to give the prisoners the best possible food.</p>
<p>Cholera was raging in the province of Albay throughout the period in
question, and the people outside of the jail suffered no less than did
those within it. The same is true of malarial infection. In other
words, conditions inside the jail were quite similar to those then
prevailing outside, except that the prisoners got polished rice which
was given them with the best intentions in the world, and was by them
considered a superior article of food.</p>
<p>With the present knowledge of the methods of dissemination of
Asiatic cholera gained as a result of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>American occupation
of the Philippines, we should probably be able to exclude it from a
jail under such circumstances, as the part played by &ldquo;germ
carriers&rdquo; who show no outward manifestations of infection is now
understood, but it was not then dreamed of. One of the greatest reforms
effected by Americans in the Philippines is the sanitation of the jails
and penitentiaries, and we cannot be fairly blamed for not knowing in
1903 what nobody then knew.</p>
<p>The troubles in Albay ended with the surrender of Ola on September
25, 1903. Blount gives the impression that he had a knowledge of them
which was gained by personal observation. He arrived in the province in
the middle of November, seven weeks after normal conditions had been
re&euml;stablished.</p>
<p>On October 5, 1903, General Bandholtz telegraphed with reference to
the final surrender of Ola&rsquo;s band:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The towns are splitting themselves wide open
celebrating pacification and Ramon Santos (later elected governor) is
going to give a record-breaking fiesta at Ligao. Everybody invited.
Scouts and Constabulary have done superb work.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blount makes much of disorders in Samar and Leyte. Let us consider
the facts.</p>
<p>In all countries feuds between highlanders and lowlanders have been
common. Although the inhabitants of the hills and those of the lowlands
in the two islands under discussion are probably of identical blood and
origin, they long since became separated in thought and feeling, and
grew to be mutually antagonistic. The ignorant people of the interior
have always been oppressed by their supposedly more highly civilized
brethren living on or near the coast.</p>
<p>The killing of Otoy by the constabulary in 1911 marked the passing
of the last of a series of mountain chiefs who had exercised a very
powerful influence over the hill people and had claimed for themselves
supernatural powers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393"
name="pb393">393</a>]</span></p>
<p>Manila hemp is the principal product upon which these mountaineers
depend in bartering for cloth and other supplies. The cleaning of hemp
involves very severe exertion, and when it is cleaned it must usually,
in Samar, be carried to the seashore on the backs of the men who raise
it. Under the most favourable circumstances, it may be transported
thither in small <i>bancas</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e10362src"
href="#xd26e10362" name="xd26e10362src">3</a> down the streams.</p>
<p>The lowland people of Samar and Leyte had long been holding up the
hill people when they brought in their hemp for sale in precisely the
way that Filipinos in other islands are accustomed to hold up members
of the non-Christian tribes. They played the part of middlemen,
purchasing the hemp of the ignorant hill people at low prices and often
reselling it, without giving it even a day&rsquo;s storage, at a very
much higher figure. This system was carried so far that conditions
became unbearable and finally resulted in so-called
<i>pul&aacute;janism</i> which began in the year 1904.</p>
<p>The term <i>pul&aacute;jan</i> is derived from a native word meaning
&ldquo;red&rdquo; and was given to the mountain people because in their
attacks upon the lowlanders they wore, as a distinguishing mark, red
trousers or a dash of red colour elsewhere about their sparse clothing.
They raided coast towns and did immense damage before they were finally
brought under control. It should be remembered that these conditions
were allowed to arise by a Filipino provincial governor, and by
Filipino municipal officials. It is altogether probable that a good
American governor would have prevented them, but as it was, neither
their cause nor their importance were understood at the outset. The
<i>pul&aacute;jan</i> movement was directed primarily against
Filipinos.</p>
<p>The first outbreak occurred on July 10, 1904, in the Gandara River
valley where a settlement of the lowlanders was burned and some of its
inhabitants were killed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href=
"#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>Eventually disorder spread to many
places on the coast, and one scout garrison of a single company was
surprised and overwhelmed by superior numbers. Officers and men were
massacred and their rifles taken.</p>

<p>In point of area Samar is the third island in the Philippines. In
its interior are many rugged peaks and heavily forested mountains. It
was here that a detachment of United States marines under the command
of Major Waller, while attempting to cross the island, were lost for
nearly two weeks, going without food for days and enduring terrible
hardships.</p>
<p>At the time in question there were not five miles of road on the
island passable for a vehicle, nor were there trails through the
mountains over which horses could be ridden. The only interior lines of
communication were a few footpaths over which the natives were
accustomed to make their way from the mountains to the coast.</p>
<p>Troops have perhaps never attempted a campaign in a country more
difficult than the interior of Samar. The traditional needle in the
haystack would be easy to find compared with an outlaw, or band of
outlaws, in such a rugged wilderness.</p>
<p>Upon the outbreak of trouble troops were hurried to Samar, and by
December, 1904, according to Blount himself, there were some 1800
native soldiers on the island who were left free for active operations
in the field by the garrisoning of various coast towns with sixteen
companies of United States infantry.</p>
<p>If the nature of the feuds between the Samar lowlanders and
highlanders had then been better understood, the ensuing troubles,
which were more or less continuous for nearly two years, might perhaps
have been avoided. As soon as it became evident that the situation was
such as to demand the use of the army it was employed to supplement the
operations of the constabulary.</p>
<p>About the time that trouble ended in Samar it began in Leyte. There
was no real connection between the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395"
href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>disorders in the two islands.
No leader on either island is known to have communicated with any
leader on the other; no fanatical follower ever left Samar for Leyte or
Leyte for Samar so far as we are informed.</p>
<p>For convenience of administration the two islands were grouped in a
single command after the army was requested to take over the handling
of the disturbances there, in co&ouml;peration with the constabulary.
The trouble ended in 1907 and both islands have remained quiet ever
since. The same causes would again produce the same results now or at
any time in the future, and they would be then, as in the past, the
outcome of the oppression of the weak by the strong and without other
political significance. Under a good government they should never
recur.</p>
<p>Many circumstances which did not exist in 1902 and 1904 made it
feasible to use the army in Samar and Leyte during 1905 and 1906. The
high officers who had exercised such sweeping powers during the
insurrection had meanwhile given way to other commanders. Indeed, a
practically new Philippine army had come into existence. The policy of
the insular government as to the treatment of individual Filipinos had
been recognized and indorsed by Americans generally, but many of the
objections to the use of the troops, including the heavy expense
involved, still existed and I affirm without fear of successful
contradiction that had it been possible to place in Samar and Leyte a
number of constabulary soldiers equal to that of the scouts and
American troops actually employed, disorder would have been terminated
much more quickly and at very greatly less cost.</p>
<p>With the final breaking up of organized brigandage in 1905 law and
order may be said to have been established throughout the islands. It
has since been the business of the constabulary to maintain it. The
value of the co&ouml;peration of the law-abiding portion of the
population has been fully recognized. The newly appointed constabulary
officer has impressed upon him the necessity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>manifesting an interest in the people with whom
he comes in contact; of cultivating the acquaintance of Filipinos of
all social grades, and of assisting to settle their disagreements and
harmonize their differences whenever possible. He is taught a native
dialect.</p>
<p>The constabulary have to a high degree merited and secured the
confidence and good-will of the people, whose rights they respect.
There is a complete absence of the old arbitrary procedure followed by
the <i lang="es">guardia civil</i> and as a result there are frequent
requests from Filipino officials for additional detachments, while the
removal of a company from a given community is almost invariably
followed by vigorous protests. The power of human sympathy is very
great, and as the attitude of constabulary officers and men is usually
one of sympathy, conciliation and affection, that body has earned and
deserved popularity.</p>
<p>The success of the constabulary in apprehending criminals has been
both praiseworthy and noteworthy. The courage and efficiency which have
often been displayed by its officers and men in hard-fought engagements
with Moro outlaws or with organized bands of thieves and brigands have
been beyond praise. Many of its officers have rendered invaluable
service in bringing the people of the more unruly non-Christian tribes
under governmental control, not only bravely and efficiently performing
their duty as police officers, but assisting in trail construction or
discharging, in effect, the duties of lieutenant-governors in very
remote places which could be visited by the actual lieutenant-governors
only infrequently. I later take occasion to mention the valuable work
done by Lieutenant Case in the early days of Ifugao, and to dwell at
length on the splendid service rendered there by Lieutenant Jeff D.
Gallman, who was for many years lieutenant-governor of the subprovince
while continuing to serve as a constabulary officer. Lieutenant Maimban
at Quiangan, and Lieutenant Dosser at Mayoyao, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span>have
been and are most useful, though they do not hold official positions
under the Mountain Province or receive any additional compensation for
the special services which they render. Captain Guy O. Fort served most
acceptably as governor of the province of Agusan during the interim
between the resignation of Governor Lewis and the appointment of
Governor Bryant and Lieutenants Atkins and Zapanta have also rendered
valuable service as assistants to the provincial governor. Lieutenant
Turnbull is now assistant to the governor of Nueva Vizcaya for work
among the Ilongots on the Pacific coast of northern Luz&oacute;n. Other
constabulary officers, who have not been called upon for special
service of this kind, have performed their ordinary duties in such a
way as to demonstrate that they were actuated by the spirit of
co&ouml;peration and have been of great help.</p>
<p>But the work of the constabulary has not been confined to police
duty. They have been of the greatest assistance to the Director of
Health in effectively maintaining quarantine, and making possible the
isolation of victims of dangerous communicable diseases like cholera
and smallpox, when inefficient municipal policemen have utterly failed
to do their duty. They have given similar assistance to the Director of
Agriculture in the maintenance of quarantine in connection with efforts
to combat diseases of domestic animals. In great emergencies such as
those presented by the recent eruption of Taal volcano, and the
devastation caused by great typhoons, they have been quick to respond
to the call of duty and have rendered efficient and heroic service.
They assist internal revenue officers. Except in a few of the largest
cities they are the firemen of the islands and by their effective work
have repeatedly checked conflagrations, which are of frequent
occurrence and tend to be very destructive in this country, where most
of the houses are built of bamboo and nipa palm, and where roofs become
dry as tinder during the long period <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb398" href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>when there is little
or no rain. They have aided in combating pests of locusts, and, in
short, have been ready to meet almost any kind of an emergency which
has arisen.</p>
<p>The importance of having such a body of alert, industrious,
disciplined, efficient men inspired by a high sense of duty, and
physically so well developed that they can continue to perform that
duty in the face of long-continued privations and hardships, is beyond
dispute. The results which have been obtained by the Philippine
constabulary have abundantly justified the policy which led to its
organization.</p>
<p>Its task has been no sinecure. Eleven officers and one hundred
ninety-seven enlisted men have been killed in action. Forty-eight
officers and nine hundred ninety-one men have died of disease.
Forty-six officers have been wounded in action. Seven hundred
sixty-eight men have been discharged for disability. Seven thousand
four hundred twenty-four firearms and 45,018 rounds of ammunition have
been captured by, or surrendered to, the constabulary. Four thousand
eight hundred sixty-two outlaws have been killed and 11,977 taken
prisoners. Twelve thousand two hundred sixty-two stolen animals have
been recovered.</p>
<p>There are many things which are not brought home to the reader by
such statistics. The weary days and nights on tropical trails; the
weakness and pain of dysentery; the freezing and the burning of
pernicious malaria; the heavy weight of responsibility when one must
act, in matters of life and death, with no superior to consult; the
disappointment when carefully laid plans go wrong; the discouragement
caused by indifference; the danger of infection with loathsome
diseases; ingratitude; deadly peril; aching wounds; sudden death, and,
worse yet, death after suffering long drawn out, when one meets
one&rsquo;s end knowing that it is coming and that one&rsquo;s family
will be left without means or resources,&mdash;these are some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>of the things that the officers and men of this
gallant corps have faced unflinchingly.</p>
<p>The work of the constabulary and of the Philippine scouts has
conclusively demonstrated the courage and efficiency of the Filipino as
a soldier when well disciplined and well led.</p>
<p>The establishment and maintenance of order in the Philippines have
afforded opportunity for some of the bravest deeds in the annals of any
race, and the opportunity has been nobly met. The head-hunters of the
Mountain Province, the Mohammedan Moros of Mindanao, Jol&oacute; and
Palawan, the bloody <i>pul&aacute;janes</i> of Samar and Leyte, the
wily <i>tulisanes</i> of Luz&oacute;n, all unrestrained by any regard
for the rules of civilized warfare, have for twelve years matched their
fanatical bravery against the gallantry of the khaki-clad Filipino
soldiers. Time and again a single officer and a handful of men have
taken chances that in almost any other land would have won them the
Victoria cross, the legion of honor, or some similar decoration. Here
their only reward has been the sense of duty well done.</p>
<p>The force known as the Philippine constabulary was organized for the
purpose of establishing and maintaining order. It has established and
is maintaining a condition of order never before equalled or approached
in the history of the islands. The policy which led to its organization
has been a thousand times justified. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Administration of Justice</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In no branch of the public administration have there
been more numerous or more beneficial reforms than in the
administration of justice. They have resulted in simplifying
organization, in decreasing the possibility of corruption and
partiality, and in diminishing the cost of litigation and the time
which it requires.</p>
<p>For the benefit of those especially interested I give in the
appendix the past and present organization of the courts.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10454src" href="#xd26e10454" name=
"xd26e10454src">1</a> The subject is too technical to interest the
average layman.</p>
<p>The slender salaries paid to judges, the fact that in the majority
of cases their appointment and promotion were due to influence and
suggestion, their liability to be transferred from one court to another
or from the Philippines to the Antilles, as frequently happened, and
the further fact that the subordinate personnel of the courts was not a
salaried one, caused the administration of justice in the Philippine
Islands to be looked upon askance. There was a general belief, well
founded in many instances, that lawsuits were won through influence or
bribery. Clerks and the subordinate personnel of the courts were
readily bribed. Indeed, they frequently demanded bribes from litigants,
or from defendants in criminal cases, under promise to expedite the
trials if paid to do so, or under threat to commit some injustice if
payment was not forthcoming. For many years after the American
occupation justices of the peace received no salaries and had to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>look to fees for their compensation. This system
worked wretchedly. The positions were only too often filled by very
incompetent and unworthy men, who stimulated litigation in order to
make more money. Now all justices of the peace receive reasonable
salaries.</p>
<p>The paying of regular salaries and the furnishing of necessary
offices and supplies have done much to improve the work of justice of
the peace courts, which are now presided over by men who average far
better than even their immediate predecessors.</p>
<p>Until they were put on a salary basis the work of the Filipino
justices of the peace left much more to be desired than is lacking at
present. In many instances they allowed gross brutalities, perpetrated
by the rich on the poor, or by the strong on the weak, to go
unpunished. The following case furnished me by an American teacher is
typical of what has occurred only too often:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On another occasion, I met the brother of my
house <i>muchacha</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10471src" href=
"#xd26e10471" name="xd26e10471src">2</a> a boy about eight. He had a
sort of protuberance on one side caused by broken ribs which had not
been set. I questioned my <i>muchacha</i>. She said her step-father had
kicked the child across the room some weeks before and broken his ribs.
The next day, I took the child together with Se&ntilde;ora Bayot, the
wife of the Governor&rsquo;s secretary, before the local Justice of the
Peace. Se&ntilde;ora Bayot translated and the child told the same story
as had his sister. The Justice of the Peace issued an order for the
step-father to report to him on the next day. That night my
<i>muchacha</i> told me that her step-father had threatened to kill the
child if he did not tell the Justice that he got the hurt by falling
out of an orange tree. The child did as ordered, and the step-father
was dismissed. When I questioned the Justice of the Peace as to why he
credited the second tale, he said the child was under oath then, and
was not under oath in the first statements.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not deemed wise at the outset to appoint a Filipino judge for
the city of Manila, as it was feared that there would be a lack of
confidence in a Filipino who had occasion to decide cases involving
large sums of money <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402"
name="pb402">402</a>]</span>in which Americans or foreigners on the one
hand and Filipinos on the other were interested; but a few years after
the establishment of the new judicial system Filipino judges had won
such a reputation for justice and fairness as to gain the confidence of
Americans and foreigners and the appointment of a Filipino judge for
the court of the city of Manila did not arouse any opposition.</p>
<div class="figure p051width" id="p051"><img src="images/p051.jpg" alt=

</div>
<p>Filipino judges of courts of first instance seem usually to have
been actuated by a desire to do full justice. The instances in which
complaints have been made against them because of partiality to party
or to race are few. Some of them have been justly criticised for
tardiness in cleaning up their dockets, and it is undoubtedly true that
their capacity for turning out work is on the average below that of
their Americans associates.</p>
<p>The fact must not be forgotten that Americans are in the majority in
the Supreme Court, which reviews the decisions of courts of first
instance, and this undoubtedly exercises a restraining influence. It is
not possible accurately to judge what would be the actions of a body of
men now subject to such control if it did not exist. It is furthermore
true that the Filipinos are more inclined to be suspicious of their own
countrymen than of Americans, and there have been from time to time
specific requests from them that judges in certain provinces be
Americans.</p>
<p>Under the Spanish r&eacute;gime the fees paid by litigants were
excessive and the use of stamped paper was compulsory. Its value ranged
from twenty-five centavos to two pesos for a folio of two sheets
according to the amount involved in the suit. Now there are fixed fees
of $8 in civil suits, except in probate matters, where the fee is
$12.</p>
<p>It was in the power of an unscrupulous litigant to make a lawsuit
almost eternal. In matters involving an amount exceeding $250 it was
lawful to institute proceedings in the action whereby the decision of
the main issue was suspended pending decision of the proceedings, and
as a decision was appealable to the <i>audiencia</i>, this was often
done <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>by attorneys who had an interest in delaying the
suit. By instituting one proceeding after another a suit could be
indefinitely prolonged.</p>
<p>Another method of securing delay was to object to the judge. In case
the judge denied the ground of the objection, a proceeding was
instituted against him and the trial of the main issue was turned over
to another judge; although the proceeding arising out of the objection
did not suspend the trial of the main issue, when the time came to
decide the latter the decision was withheld until the proceeding
arising out of the objection was settled, and as this latter was one in
connection with which other proceedings could be instituted which might
delay the decision and consequently the decision of the main issue,
there was no end to the matter.</p>
<p>To-day all this has been stopped by the procedure in court. The
challenging of judges is not allowed, although they must refrain from
the trial of any matter when they are disqualified in any way as
regards it. Proceedings which suspend the trial of the main issue
cannot be instituted. The procedure itself is more expeditious, the
time allowances and formalities have been reduced, and all the long
Spanish civil procedure regarding the presentation of evidence has been
shortened. Suits are settled with a speediness previously unknown. In
order to avoid delay on the part of judges in rendering decisions, an
act has been passed prohibiting the payment of their salaries without a
certificate that they have no matter which has been awaiting decision
for more than three months.</p>
<p>Owing to the inquisitorial procedure which obtained under Spanish
rule, the disposition of criminal cases was even slower than that of
civil cases. The cause would be commenced, either <i lang="es">de
officio</i>, by the judge who had a knowledge of the crime, or by the
prosecuting attorney, or by virtue of private accusation on the part of
the person aggrieved. The case once started, the investigations made
during the period known as the <i lang="es">sumario</i> were conducted
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>the absence of the accused. The latter had no
hand in the case, as it was thought that the reserve and secrecy of the
procedure ought not to be violated to the end that the accused might
not frustrate the evidence of the prosecution by preparing his defence.
Owing many times to the inactivity of the judge or of the prosecuting
attorney, to the great amount of work which weighed down the
courts&mdash;for actions were begun when there was knowledge of the
commission of the crime, although the perpetrators were not
known&mdash;and by the manipulations at other times of the private
accuser to whose interest it was to harm the accused by delaying the
<i lang="es">sumario</i>, this period was often made to extend over
years and years. Meanwhile the defendant was confined in prison, as no
bail was allowed in any case in which the penalty was that of <i lang=
"es">presidio correccional</i> (from six months and one day to six
years&rsquo; imprisonment) or greater. In addition to this the
circumstance that all criminal causes in the islands had to be sent for
review to the proper <i lang="es">audiencia</i>, caused a large
accumulation of old cases in these higher courts, and this alone made
their disposition a matter of some years.</p>
<p>To-day the procedure is rapid. Information having been brought
against the defendant, the trial is had in the same term or at most
during the next term of court. Sometimes the trial is suspended owing
to the non-appearance of witnesses, but it can be said that cases are
rare where causes are pending in the docket of the court for a longer
period than two terms. Causes appealed to the Supreme Court are
disposed of promptly, and as a general rule it does not take over six
months to get a decision.</p>
<p>Defendants in criminal cases have now been granted by the Philippine
Bill certain fundamentally important rights which they did not formerly
enjoy; namely, to appear and defend in person or by counsel at every
stage of the proceedings; to be informed of the nature and cause of the
accusation; to testify as witnesses in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>own
behalf; to be exempt from testifying against themselves; to be
confronted at the trial by, and to cross-examine, the witnesses against
them; to have compulsory process issue for obtaining witnesses in their
own favour; to have speedy and public trials; to be admitted to bail
with sufficient sureties in all cases, except for capital offences.
None of these rights were enjoyed under the procedure in effect during
the Spanish r&eacute;gime. A man was prosecuted without being notified
of the charges against him, and he was only made aware of the case
against him after the <i lang="es">sumario</i>. When all of the
evidence of the prosecution had been taken the accused was heard in his
own defence. He was compelled to testify, and was subjected to a very
inquisitorial examination, including questions which incriminated him.
Although he had the right to compel witnesses for the prosecution to
ratify over their signatures the evidence against him given during the
<i lang="es">sumario</i>, as the defence of the majority of the accused
was in the hands of attorneys <i lang="es">de officio</i> they nearly
always renounced this privilege of the defendant, and, as has already
been said, bail was not admitted in any grave offence during the
trial.</p>
<p>No sentence of acquittal in a criminal case can now be appealed from
by the government. Under the Spanish system sentences of acquittal of
courts of first instance had to be referred for review to the proper
<i lang="es">audiencia</i> and the fiscal of the latter could appeal
from a sentence of acquittal by it.</p>
<p>The Philippine Bill grants to the inhabitants of the islands other
important individual rights which they did not formerly possess.</p>
<p>The Spanish constitution was not in force here, and although the
Penal Code contained provisions for punishing, in a way, officials who
violated certain rights granted by the Spanish constitution, citizens
had no expeditious method of securing their punishment. Now the Code of
Civil Procedure grants them certain special remedies by which their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>rights can be made good. To illustrate: Under
the Spanish r&eacute;gime the only remedy for a man illegally detained
was to bring a criminal action against the person illegally detaining
him. He did not have the remedy of the writ of habeas corpus nor the
writ of prohibition against an official who attempted to make him the
victim of some unlawful act. His only remedy was to bring a criminal
action against such official, or to sue him for damages. He could not
compel public officials to perform their ministerial duties by mandamus
proceedings.</p>
<p>The individual rights conferred by the Philippine Bill, and the
special remedies granted by the Code of Civil Procedure, assure to the
inhabitants of the islands liberties and privileges entirely unknown to
them during the days of Spanish sovereignty, and these liberties and
privileges are adequately safeguarded.</p>
<p>Two things still greatly complicate the administration of justice in
the Philippines.</p>
<p>The first is the dense ignorance of the people of the working class
who for the most part have failed to learn of their new rights, and
even if they know them are afraid to attempt to assert them in
opposition to the will of the <i lang="es">caciques</i>, whose power
for evil they know only too well.</p>
<p>The other is the unreliability of many witnesses and their shocking
readiness to perjure themselves. It is always possible to manufacture
testimony at small expense. While the criminal libel suit brought
against certain members of the staff of the newspaper <i lang="es">El
Renacimiento</i>, which libelled me, was in progress the judge showed
me the opinion of the two Filipino assessors<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10569src" href="#xd26e10569" name="xd26e10569src">3</a> in one of
the cases and told me that it was written by an attorney for the
defence. I could not believe this, but a few days later an assessor in
another of the cases called at my house, bringing a draft of the
opinion of himself and his associate which he sought to submit to me
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>criticism or modification, saying that I knew
much more about the case than they did! He was nonplussed at my refusal
to read the document, and left saying &ldquo;<i lang="es">acqui tiene
V. nuevo servidor</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10577src"
href="#xd26e10577" name="xd26e10577src">4</a> Had I redrafted the
opinion, as I might have done, my &ldquo;new servant&rdquo; would have
called later for a <i lang="la">quid pro quo</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the Filipino judges of first instance have proved weak in
matters affecting the integrity of public domain and the protection of
the public forests, but on the whole these officers have done rather
surprisingly well. It must be remembered that the best men in the
islands have now been appointed, and that another generation must come
on before there will be available any considerable number of new
candidates who are up to the standard of the present appointees.

<h2 class="main">Health Conditions</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I had abundant opportunity to observe health
conditions in the Philippines during the Spanish r&eacute;gime and they
were shocking in the extreme. There were no provisions for the sanitary
disposal of human waste even in Manila. If one had occasion to be out
on foot at night, it was wise to keep in the middle of the street and
still wiser to carry a raised umbrella.</p>
<p>Immediately after the American occupation some five hundred barrels
of caked excrement were taken from a single tower in one of the old
Manila monasteries. The moat around the city wall, and the <i lang=
"es">esteros</i>, or tidal creeks, reeked with filth, and the smells
which assailed one&rsquo;s nostrils, especially, at night, were
disgusting.</p>
<p>Distilled water was not to be had for drinking purposes. The city
water supply came from the Mariquina River, and some fifteen thousand
Filipinos lived on or near the banks of that stream above the intake.
The water was often so thick with sediment that one could not see
through a glass of it, and it was out of the question to attempt to get
it boiled unless one had facilities of one&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>Conditions in the provinces were proportionately worse. As a rule,
there was no evidence of any effort to put provincial towns into decent
sanitary conditions. I must, however, note one striking exception.
Brigadier General Juan Arolas, long the governor of Jol&oacute;, had a
thorough knowledge of modern sanitary methods and a keen appreciation
of the benefits derivable from their application. When he was sent to
Jol&oacute;, practically in banishment, the town was a plague spot to
which were assigned Spaniards whose early demise would have been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>looked upon with favour by those in power. He
converted it into a healthy place the death rate of which compared
favourably with that of European cities, thereby demonstrating
conclusively what could be done even under very unfavourable
conditions. No troops in the islands were kept in anything like such
physical condition as were the regiments assigned to him, and he bore a
lasting grudge against any one inconsiderate enough to die in
Jol&oacute;.</p>
<p>Everywhere I saw people dying of curable ailments. Malaria was
prevalent in many regions in which it was impossible to secure good
quinine. The stuff on sale usually consisted largely of cornstarch, or
plaster of Paris. Fortunately we had brought with us from the United
States a great quantity of quinine and we made friends with the
Filipinos in many a town by giving this drug gratis to their sick.</p>
<p>Smallpox was generally regarded as a necessary ailment of childhood.
It was a common thing to see children covered with the eruption of this
disease watching, or joining in, the play of groups of healthy little
ones.</p>
<p>The clothing of people who had died of smallpox was handed on to
other members of the family, sometimes without even being washed. The
victims of the disease often immersed themselves in cold water when
their fever was high, and paid the penalty for their ignorance with
their lives.</p>
<p>The average Spaniard was a firm believer in the noxiousness of night
air, which he said produced <i>paludismo</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10619src" href="#xd26e10619" name="xd26e10619src">1</a> Most
Filipinos were afraid of an imaginary spirit, devil or mythical
creature known as <i>asu&aacute;ng</i>, and closed their windows and
doors after dark as a protection against it. Thus it came about that in
a country where fresh air is especially necessary at night no one got
it.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis was dreadfully common, and its victims were conveying
it to others without let or hindrance.</p>

<p>A distressingly large percentage of native-born infants died before
reaching one year of age on account of infection at birth, insufficient
clothing, or improper food. I have many times seen a native mother
thrust boiled rice into the mouth of a child only a few days old, and I
have seen babies taught to smoke tobacco before they could walk.</p>
<p>Before our party left the islands in 1888, cholera had broken out at
a remote and isolated place. A little later it spread over a
considerable part of the archipelago. On my return in 1890 I heard the
most shocking stories of what had occurred. Victims of this disease
were regarded with such fear and horror by their friends that they were
not infrequently carried out while in a state of coma, and buried
alive. It became necessary to issue orders to have shelters prepared in
cemeteries under which bodies were required to be deposited and left
for a certain number of hours before burial, in order to prevent this
result.</p>
<p>In Siquijor an unfortunate, carried to the cemetery after he had
lost consciousness, came to himself, crawled out from under a mass of
corpses which had been piled on top of him, got up and walked home.
When he entered his house, his assembled friends and relatives vacated
it through the windows, believing him to be his own ghost. They did not
return until morning, when they found him dead on the floor.</p>
<p>I heard a well-authenticated story of a case in which all the
members of a family died except a creeping infant who subsisted for
some time by sucking a breeding sow which was being kept in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>During the great cholera epidemic in 1882 it is said that the
approaches to the Manila cemeteries were blocked with vehicles of every
description loaded with corpses, and that the stench from unburied
bodies in the San Lazaro district was so dreadful that one could hardly
go through it.</p>
<p>Beri-beri was common among the occupants of jails, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>lighthouses and other government institutions,
as well as in certain garrisoned towns like Balabac.</p>
<p>In 1892 I found the wife of a very dear Spanish friend dying from an
ailment which in the United States could have been promptly and
certainly remedied by a surgical operation. I begged him to take her to
Manila, telling him of the ease with which any fairly good surgeon
would relieve her, and promising to interest myself in her case on my
arrival there. To my utter amazement I found that there was not a
surgeon in the Philippine Islands who would venture to open the human
abdomen. The one man who had sometimes done this in Spain stated that
it would be impossible for him to undertake it in Manila, on account of
the lack of a suitable operating room, of instruments and of the
necessary anaesthetist and other professional assistants. In fact, at
the time of the American occupation there was not a modern operating
room, much less a modern hospital, in the Philippines. Thousands upon
thousands of people were perishing needlessly every year for the lack
of surgical intervention. A common procedure in dealing with wounds was
to cover them with poultices of chewed tobacco, ashes, and leaves.</p>
<p>In many provinces the people were without medical assistance of any
sort, and fell into the hands of native quacks who were little, if at
all, better than witch doctors.</p>
<p>The most fantastic views were entertained relative to the causation
of disease. In some towns it was vigorously asserted that after a
peculiar looking black dog ran down the street cholera appeared. In
other places cholera was generally ascribed to the poisoning of wells
by Spaniards or foreigners.</p>
<p>Cemeteries were not infrequently situated in the very midst of
towns, or near the local supplies of drinking water. Conditions within
their walls were often shocking from an aesthetic view point. As the
area available for burials was limited, and the graves were usually
unmarked, parts of decomposed bodies were constantly being dug up. It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>was the custom to throw such remains about the
foot of the cross at the centre of the cemetery.</p>
<p>Military sanitation was also very bad. I was at Zamboanga when the
wreck of General Weyler&rsquo;s expedition to Lake Lanoa began to
return. There had been no adequate provision for the medical care of
the force in the field, and the condition of many of the soldiers was
pitiable in the extreme. Disabled men were brought in by the shipload,
and the hospitals at Zamboanga, Isabela de Basilan and Jol&oacute; were
soon filled to overflowing.</p>
<p>The lack of adequate sanitary measures was equally in evidence in
dealing with cattle disease. Rinderpest, a highly contagious and very
destructive disease of horned cattle, was introduced in 1888 and spread
like fire in prairie grass. No real effort was made to check it prior
to the American occupation, and it caused enormous losses, both
directly by killing large numbers of beef cattle and indirectly by
depriving farmers of draft animals.</p>
<p>When I first visited the islands every member of our party fell ill
within a few weeks. All of us suffered intensely from tropical ulcers.
Two had malaria; one had dysentery; one, acute inflammation of the
liver, possibly of amoebic origin; and so on to the end of the chapter.
I myself got so loaded up with malaria in Mindoro that it took me
fifteen years to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Fortunately the American army of occupation brought with it numerous
competent physicians and surgeons, and abundant hospital equipment and
supplies, for the soldiers promptly contracted about all the different
ailments to be acquired in the islands.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Manila on the 5th of March, 1899, I found that a
great army hospital, called the &ldquo;First Reserve,&rdquo; had been
established in the old rice market. There was another sizable one on
the Bagumbayan drive. A third occupied a large building belonging to
French sisters of charity which was ordinarily used for school
purposes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span></p>
<p>In immediate connection with the First Reserve Hospital was a tent
hospital where sick and wounded Insurgents were being given the best of
care.</p>
<p>Field hospitals were promptly established as the troops moved out
from Manila, and in connection with many of these Filipinos were given
much needed medical and surgical help. The recipients of such kindly
treatment were, however, prohibited by Insurgent officers from telling
others of their experiences lest the hatred of Americans diminish as a
result.</p>
<p>Smallpox had broken out among the Spanish soldiers in the walled
city and was spreading badly when my friend, Major Frank S. Bourns of
the army medical corps, was given the task of eradicating it, which he
promptly accomplished. A little later the use of the Santa Ana church
as a smallpox hospital was authorized, and sick Filipinos were
carefully tended there.</p>
<p>The army promptly set about cleaning up Manila and waging war upon
the more serious ailments which threatened the health of the soldiers
and that of the public. The work was at the outset put under the
direction of Major Edie, a very capable and efficient medical officer.
Subsequently it was turned over to Major Bourns, who, on account of his
intimate knowledge of Spanish, and his wide acquaintance with the
Filipinos, was able to carry out many much-needed reforms, and in doing
so aroused a minimum of public antagonism.</p>
<p>Upon the establishment of civil government Governor Taft was very
desirous of retaining Major Bourns&rsquo;s services, but this did not
prove practicable, as he desired to give up government work and engage
in private business.</p>
<p>There was promptly created an efficient board of health made up of
men of recognized ability and large practical experience. Its chairman
was Major Louis M. Maus, commissioner of public health. The other
members were Mr. H. D. Osgood, sanitary engineer; Dr. Franklin H.
Meacham, chief sanitary inspector; Dr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>Paul C. Freer,
superintendent of government laboratories; and Dr. Manuel Gomez,
secretary.</p>
<p>This board was promptly put upon its mettle. It had inherited from
the army an incipient epidemic of bubonic plague in Manila, and the
disease soon spread to Cavite and also to Ceb&uacute;, then the second
port of the Philippines in commercial importance. It also appeared in
several provincial towns near Cavite. An effective campaign against it,
inaugurated at this time, was never abandoned until it was completely
eradicated in 1906,&mdash;a noteworthy result to achieve in a country
like the Philippines.</p>
<p>On March 21, 1902, I was advised that two patients at San Juan de
Dios hospital were developing symptoms of Asiatic cholera, and on the
following day a positive laboratory diagnosis was made. Other cases
followed in quick succession, and we soon found ourselves facing a
virulent epidemic of this highly dangerous disease. At the outset the
mortality was practically 100 per cent. Unfortunately, there was no one
connected with the medical service of the islands who had had practical
experience in dealing with cholera, and we had to get this as we went
along.</p>
<p>At the time of the outbreak, Governor Taft was in the United States,
Acting Governor Wright was in Leyte, the secretary of finance and
justice was in Japan, and there were present in Manila only the
secretary of public instruction and the secretary of the interior. As
the executive head of the government was absent, and there was no
quorum of the legislative body, I of necessity arrogated to myself
powers which I did not lawfully possess, appointing employees and
incurring expenses without the usual formalities.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 22 I informed General Chaffee that four
cases of cholera had occurred in Manila, and requested that an adequate
military force be despatched to the valley of the Mariquina River to
protect the city water supply from possible contamination. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span></p>
<p>This request was promptly acceded to, and the guard thereafter
maintained proved adequate to prevent infection of the city water,
although there are three towns on the river above the intake, and it
was the custom of their people to bathe and wash their clothing in this
stream. Many of the filthy surface wells of the city were filled as
rapidly as possible, and those that could not be filled were
closed.</p>
<p>The people, entirely unaccustomed as they were to any sanitary
restrictions, believing that the disease was not cholera, and firm in
their conviction that they had a right to do whatever they liked so
long as they kept on their own premises, bitterly resented the burning
or disinfection of their houses and effects, and the restriction of
their liberty to go and come as they pleased, and in spite of the fact
that the number of cases was kept down in a manner never before dreamed
of at Manila, there arose an increasingly bitter feeling of hostility
toward the work of the board of health. In fact, the very success of
the campaign proved an obstacle, and we were assured that the disease
could not be cholera, as, if it were, there would be a thousand deaths
a day!</p>
<p>An educational campaign was immediately begun, and simple directions
for avoiding infection were published and scattered broadcast.
Distilled water was furnished gratis to all who would drink it,
stations for its distribution being established through the city and
supplemented by large water wagons driven through the streets. The sale
of foods likely to convey the disease was prohibited. Large numbers of
emergency sanitary inspectors were immediately appointed, and every
effort was made to detect all cases as soon as possible. A land
quarantine was established around the city, to protect the
provinces.</p>
<p>In anticipation of a possible extensive outbreak of contagious
disease a detention camp capable of accommodating some twenty-five
hundred people had been established previously on the San Lazaro
grounds, and to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416"
name="pb416">416</a>]</span>this place were taken the cholera
&ldquo;contacts.&rdquo; A cholera hospital was opened near this camp,
and the stricken were removed to it from their homes as speedily as
possible, the buildings which they had occupied being thoroughly
disinfected, or burned if disinfection was impracticable.</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead were at the outset either buried in
hermetically sealed coffins or cremated. When the detention camp and
hospital at San Lazaro threatened to become crowded, a second camp and
hospital were established at Santa Mesa. At this latter place both
&ldquo;contacts&rdquo; and the sick were obliged to live in tents.</p>
<p>The Spanish residents were allowed to establish a private cholera
hospital in a large and well-ventilated <i>convento</i> on Calle
Herran. As the number of sick Spaniards was nothing like sufficient to
fill this building, they were asked to turn over the unoccupied space
in it to the board of health, which they most generously did.</p>
<p>In response to popular clamour a hospital under strictly Filipino
management was opened in a nipa building in Tondo. Interest in it soon
flagged, and the government found itself with this institution on its
hands.</p>
<p>The epidemic came soon after the close of a long-continued war, and
there were at that time in Manila not a few evil-intentioned persons,
both foreign and native, who welcomed every opportunity to make
trouble. The difficulties arising from the claim advanced by a number
of reputable but ignorant medical men that the disease was not cholera
at all were sufficiently great. They were enormously increased by false
and malicious stories to the effect that &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; were
killed at the detention camp; that patients on arrival at the cholera
hospital were given a drink of poisoned <i>vino</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10720src" href="#xd26e10720" name="xd26e10720src">2</a> and
instantly dropped dead; that the distilled water distributed free of
charge was poisoned, and that the Americans were poisoning the wells.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span></p>
<p>The necessary use of strychnine as a heart stimulant at the cholera
hospital was made the basis for a story that the sick were being
poisoned with this drug.</p>
<p>These silly tales were widely circulated and quite generally
believed, and as a result of the fear thus engendered, and of the
desire on the part of relatives and neighbours of stricken persons to
escape disinfection and quarantine, strong efforts were often made to
conceal the sick and the dead, and when this was not possible the
&ldquo;contacts&rdquo; usually ran away. There were not wanting
instances of the driving of cholera victims into the streets.</p>
<p>In spite of the generally hostile attitude of the public and some
grave mistakes in policy, the measures adopted sufficed at the outset
to hold the disease in check to an extent which surprised even the
health officers themselves.</p>
<p>On May 15 there began a rapid and quite steady decline in the number
of cases.</p>
<p>In June, however, it increased. During July it grew steadily larger,
and on the 25th of that month there were ninety-one cases, the largest
number which has ever occurred in Manila on any day since the American
occupation.</p>
<p>Throughout the early months of the epidemic Major Maus had laboured
unceasingly to check it, displaying an energy and an indifference to
fatigue and personal discomfort which were highly commendable. The
long-continued strain ultimately began to tell on him severely. On May
17 orders were received from the Adjutant-General&rsquo;s Office
providing for his relief on or about July 30, and stating that Major E.
C. Carter, of the United States Army Medical Corps, would be available
for detail as commissioner of public health on that date, if his
services were desired. Arrangements were accordingly made to have Major
Carter proceed to the Philippines. Major Maus&rsquo;s resignation was
accepted, effective July 31. Dr. Frank S. Bourns was urged to take
temporary charge of the situation, and consented to do so.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name=
"pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the 8th of August Major Carter arrived and announced his
readiness to assume his duties, but it was suggested to him that he
ought first to have some time to familiarize himself with them, and Dr.
Bourns was left free to carry out the special work for which he had
been appointed.</p>
<p>This he did with promptness and despatch, the number of cases for
August being but seven hundred twenty as against thirteen hundred
sixty-eight for the previous month. On the 8th of September, having
brought the disease under control at Manila, he insisted on resigning
in order to attend to his private affairs, which were suffering from
neglect, and his resignation was reluctantly accepted.</p>
<p>Dr. Bourns&rsquo;s remarkable success in dealing with a very
difficult situation was largely due to his ability to devise measures
which, while thoroughly effective, were less irritating to the public
than were those which had been previously employed.</p>
<p>The policy which he had inaugurated was followed by his successor
with the result that the cases fell to two hundred seventy-five in
September and eighty-eight in October. In November there was a slight
recrudescence, but the disease did not again threaten to escape control
and in February practically disappeared, there being but two cases
during the entire month.</p>
<p>The return of hot, damp weather again produced a slight
recrudescence, and scattering cases continued to occur until March,
when the epidemic of 1902&ndash;1904 ended in Manila.</p>
<p>In view of the conditions which then prevailed and of the extreme
risk of a general infection of the city water supply, which, had it
occurred, would doubtless have resulted in the death of a third of the
population, this is a record of which the Bureau of Health may well be
proud.</p>
<p>The effort to prevent the spread of infection by maintaining a land
quarantine around Manila proved entirely <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb419" href="#pb419" name="pb419">419</a>]</span>ineffective. The
disease promptly appeared in the provinces where the campaign against
it was from the outset in charge of newly appointed Filipino presidents
of provincial boards of health, aided, when practicable, by medical
inspectors from Manila.</p>
<p>Before it was finally checked in Manila there were 5581 cases with
4386 deaths; while in the provinces, in many of which it necessarily
long ran its course practically unhindered, there were 160,671 cases,
with 105,075 deaths.</p>
<p>On the 27th of April, 1904, the Board of Health passed the following
resolutions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Whereas cases of Asiatic cholera have occurred
in but three provincial towns of the Philippine Islands since February
8, 1904; and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas only one case of Asiatic cholera has been reported as
occurring any place in the Philippine Islands since March 8, 1904;
and</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas the city of Manila was declared on March 23 to be
free from the infection of Asiatic cholera; On motion</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That the islands composing the Philippine
Archipelago are, and are hereby declared to be, free from the infection
of Asiatic cholera; and</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Be it further resolved</i>, That the Commissioner of
Public Health be directed to send a copy of these resolutions to the
honourable the Secretary of the Interior, the Municipal Board, the
United States Marine-Hospital Service, and the Collector of
Customs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, however, it later proved that cholera was
endemic in certain swampy regions near Manila, and in 1905 we found
ourselves with a new epidemic on our hands.</p>
<p>At the end of the second week, beginning August 23, there had been
one hundred thirty-seven cases, as compared with one hundred
twenty-five for the same period during the epidemic of
1902&ndash;1904.</p>
<p>However, the conditions for combating cholera were now far more
favourable than in 1902. Major E. C. Carter had at his own request been
relieved from duty as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href=
"#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>commissioner of public health, and
Dr. Victor G. Heiser, passed assistant surgeon of the United States
public health and marine hospital service, had been appointed to
succeed him on April 5, 1905. Dr. Heiser was a highly trained officer
of one of the most efficient services which has ever been organized for
the combating of contagious and infectious diseases.</p>
<p>He had under him in the city of Manila a small but thoroughly
trained body of twenty-four medical inspectors, of whom nineteen were
Americans and five Filipinos. Profiting by his previous experience and
that of his predecessors in the Philippine service, he inaugurated a
campaign which practically terminated the epidemic in Manila on
February 21, 1906,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10793src" href=
"#xd26e10793" name="xd26e10793src">3</a> with a total of two hundred
eighty-three cases and two hundred forty-three deaths.</p>
<p>This brief and decisive campaign reflects the greatest credit on all
concerned with it.</p>
<p>The board of health had one great advantage in the fact that the San
Lazaro contagious disease hospital had been completed. This building,
with its cool wards and attractive surroundings, made it possible to
give cholera victims the best of care.</p>
<p>There was at the outset little or no fear of this hospital, but
apparently this condition of things was not satisfactory to that small
but dangerous element of the Manila public which from the time of the
American occupation has never let pass any opportunity to make trouble.
As usual, the medium of attack was the local press. <i lang=
"es">Soberan&iacute;a Nacional</i> published a most extraordinary
article painting in vivid colours the alleged horrors of the San Lazaro
Hospital, and stating among other things that the naked bodies of the
dead, tagged and with their feet tied together, lay about the entrance
of that institution. A more false statement was never published.</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours after its appearance terror <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>reigned among the lower classes, and living and
dead cholera victims were being smuggled out of the city to
neighbouring towns.</p>
<p>Feeling that the vicious attitude of a certain section of the press
had cost lives enough, I sent the editor of this paper a courteous
invitation to call at my office. He made no response. I then wrote him,
demanding a retraction, and sending him a correct statement to
publish.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10812src" href="#xd26e10812" name=
"xd26e10812src">4</a></p>
<p>He was at first disposed to argue the matter, but finding that I
meant business published the article which I sent to him and made the
following retraction:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href=
"#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We are exceedingly glad to affirm in the honour
of truth and justice, that the news given by us on the seventh instant
under the title &lsquo;Painful Scenes,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Naked
Dead,&rsquo; is absolutely absurd, false and unreasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have investigated the truth of the said notice, and can
affirm to our readers that it is entirely inaccurate, as in the
courtyard of the said hospital the naked dead that we have spoken of
are not now exposed, nor have they ever been so exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is above all things, and to rectify a baseless
piece of news should not be a doubtful action on the part of the person
who gave the news, but rather something in his favour that the public
should appreciate it at its full value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To conclude, we must record our gratitude to the Secretary of
the Interior, the Hon. Dean C. Worcester, for the investigations made
in the premises with the purpose of ascertaining the truth of the
alleged facts, and for the courteous way in which he received us this
morning when interviewed by one of our reporters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the provinces the results of the campaign against cholera were
far less satisfactory than in Manila as was to be anticipated, owing to
lack of adequate personnel, but the cases, which numbered 34,238 and
deaths which numbered 22,938, were far fewer than during the previous
epidemic.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt here to trace the course of the subsequent
epidemics which have occurred from time to time, but shall content
myself with giving the deaths by years. In 1908, they numbered 18,811;
in 1909, 7306; in 1910, 6940; in 1911, 203. In 1912, there were none,
and thus far in 1913 there have been none.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10865src" href="#xd26e10865" name="xd26e10865src">5</a></p>
<p>The superstitious practices which were formerly employed by the
Filipinos to combat this scourge have given way to simple and
inexpensive hygienic measures, and we can safely count on sufficient
co&ouml;peration from the people to make an effective campaign possible
when it next appears.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the strain of the early days of the first
epidemic. Two of my best men, Dr. Meacham and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span>Mr.
Mudge, literally worked themselves to death, remaining on duty when
they knew that they were in imminent danger, and in the end laying down
their lives willingly for an alien and hostile people. Such things make
one proud of being an American.</p>
<p>At times the situation was not devoid of amusing features. I had
occasion to visit one of the northern provinces, where the epidemic was
especially severe, in an effort to calm the panic-stricken populace. I
stayed with the governor, a very intelligent Filipino. For obvious
reasons I investigated his domestic arrangements, finding that he was
boiling drinking water, thoroughly cooking all food, and taking all
usual and necessary precautions to prevent infection.</p>
<p>On returning to his house the first evening, after a short absence,
I found the grounds decorated with lighted Japanese lanterns. Supposing
that the proverbial Filipino hospitality had risen above even such
untoward circumstances as those which then existed, I asked the
governor what the entertainment was to be. In evident perplexity he
replied that he had not planned to have any entertainment, and on my
inquiring what the lanterns were for, said he had heard that they were
good to keep away cholera germs!</p>
<p>I have referred to the fact that the civil government inherited a
fairly well developed epidemic of bubonic plague. In 1901 this disease
caused four hundred twenty-seven deaths, in 1902 it caused ten only,
but the demands made on the sanitary force by the cholera epidemic
which began in that year rendered it impossible to give to plague the
attention which it otherwise would have had, with the result that in
1903 we had one hundred seventy-four deaths. In 1904 there were
seventy-eight; in 1905, forty-three; in 1906, seven; in 1907, none; and
from 1907 until 1912, none. In the latter year the disease was
reintroduced.</p>
<p>Rats become infected with it, and fleas transmit it from them to
human beings. It was probably brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>in by pestiferous
rodents hidden inside packages of vegetables, as it appeared in a
district where crates of vegetables are opened in large numbers, and
did not appear in the vicinity of the piers, although shore rats are
abundant there, and if diseased rodents had landed from shipping, would
promptly have become infected,&mdash;a thing which did not occur.</p>
<p>At about the same time plague also appeared at Iloilo, where it was
eradicated with a total of nine deaths. At Manila there have been up to
the present time<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10887src" href=
"#xd26e10887" name="xd26e10887src">6</a> fifty-nine deaths, and
scattering cases continue to occur at considerable intervals.</p>
<p>Had plague not been promptly and effectively combated, it would
unquestionably have spread rapidly, causing untold misery and heavy
property losses.</p>
<p>As I have previously stated, at the time of the American occupation
smallpox was by many people regarded as an almost inevitable ailment of
childhood. It proved necessary to secure the passage of legislation
forbidding the inoculation of human beings with it to prevent misguided
Filipinos from deliberately communicating it to their children, not
because they did not dearly love them, but because they regarded
infection with it as a calamity sure to come sooner or later, and
desired to have it over with once for all.</p>
<p>We have performed more than ten million vaccinations, with the
result that the annual deaths from this disease have decreased from
forty thousand at the outset to seven hundred for the year just ended.
There is now less smallpox in Manila than in Washington.</p>
<p>In the six provinces nearest Manila it was killing, on the average,
six thousand persons annually. For a year after we finished vaccinating
the inhabitants of these provinces it did not cause a death among them;
nor has it since caused such a death except among new-born children or
newly arrived unvaccinated persons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span></p>
<p>These extraordinary results have been achieved without the loss of a
life or a limb so far as we know. The vaccine used was prepared by our
own Bureau of Science with extraordinary care, and has proved to be
remarkably pure and active.</p>
<p>We at first endeavoured to have vaccinations performed by local
Filipino health officers, but, after spending large sums without
obtaining satisfactory results, gave up this plan and substituted
therefor a method of procedure by which the work was carried on under
the very immediate supervision of the director of health. We then made
substantial progress. However, under the law as it at present stands,
succeeding annual vaccination, intended to insure the immunization of
children soon after they are born and of unvaccinated persons who may
come into a given territory, are intrusted to the local Filipino
authorities, with the result that in very many cases they are not
attended to. We get elaborate returns showing the number of persons
vaccinated. Then comes an outbreak of smallpox, and on investigation we
learn that the vaccinations so fully reported were made on paper only!
In other words, the continuance of this work, of such vital importance
to the Filipino people, is still directly dependent upon continued
control by American health officers.</p>
<p>Another great problem now in a fair way to final solution is the
eradication of leprosy. At the outset we were told by the church
authorities that there were thirty thousand lepers in the islands. In
1905 we began to isolate and care for all supposed victims of this
disease, only to find that many outcasts believed to be suffering from
it were really afflicted with curable ailments. We were able to restore
a very large number of them to society, to their great joy and that of
their friends.</p>
<p>A few hundreds of true lepers were being humanely cared for in
Manila and elsewhere. Many others had been driven out of the towns into
forests or waste places on the larger islands, where they were
perishing miserably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426"
name="pb426">426</a>]</span>from fever and other diseases. Still others
had been isolated on sand quays, where they were in danger of dying
from thirst during the dry season. Not a few wandered through the towns
at will, spreading the disease broadcast.</p>
<div class="figure p054width" id="p054"><img src="images/p054.jpg" alt=
"Travel under Difficulties" width="720" height="428">
<p class="figureHead">Travel under Difficulties</p>
<p class="first">One of our bamboo rafts, loaded with baggage, on the
Mab&aacute;ca River.</p>
</div>
<p>All known lepers are now cared for at Culion, a healthful, sanitary
town with good streets, excellent water and sewer systems, many modern
concrete buildings and a first-class hospital.</p>
<p>They are not confined to the limits of the town, but wander at will,
except that they are excluded from the immediate vicinity of the houses
of the officers and employees of the colony.</p>
<p>They may have their little farms, and raise pigs, chickens,
vegetables, etc., if they wish. They may, and do, float about over the
waters of the neighbouring bay in boats or on rafts, and fish to their
hearts&rsquo; content. They are well fed and well cared for, and their
physical condition improves to a marked degree promptly after their
arrival at the colony. The only hardship which they suffer is that
necessarily involved in separation from their relatives and friends,
and this is mitigated by occasional visits which the latter may make
them.</p>
<p>Since we began to isolate lepers, their number has decreased to
approximately three thousand, and with a continuance of the present
policy the disease should soon disappear from the Philippines.</p>
<p>During the period immediately subsequent to the American occupation,
amoebic dysentery wrought sad havoc both among our soldiers and among
civil government officers and employees. Four of my own family of five
had it, and one had it twice, in spite of the fact that we took all
known precautions; and the experience of my family was by no means
exceptional. This disease then annually cost the lives of a large
number of American men and women, and a considerable additional number
went home invalids for life as a result of infection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>with
it. We seemed to hear almost daily of some new case.</p>
<p>Careful scientific investigation carried on at the bureau of science
taught us the best methods of combating this type of dysentery, and the
proper disposal of human feces, the regulation of methods used in
fertilizing vegetables, improvement in supplies of drinking water, and
other simple, hygienic measures have reduced the deaths from it among
Americans to an almost negligible minimum. Such cases as occur are
almost without exception detected early, and readily yield to
treatment.</p>
<p>The belief that Filipinos do not suffer from this disease has proved
to be without foundation. It kills thousands of them every year. Those
who are willing to adopt the simple precautions which experience has
shown to be necessary may enjoy the large degree of immunity from it
which Americans now have.</p>
<p>The chief cause of amoebic dysentery in the Philippines has
undoubtedly been infected drinking water. From time immemorial the
people have been obtaining their water for drinking purposes from
flowing streams, open springs or shallow surface wells.</p>
<p>The wells were especially dangerous, as it was the common custom to
wash clothing around them so that water containing disease germs
frequently seeped into wells used by whole villages. The results of
such conditions during a cholera epidemic can readily be imagined.</p>
<p>The drinking supplies of many provincial towns have now been
radically improved by the sinking of 853 successful artesian wells.</p>
<p>In many places there has been a resulting reduction of more than
fifty per cent in the annual death rate. Large sums are spent yearly by
the government in drilling additional wells,&mdash;a policy which is
warmly approved by the common people. The recent appropriations for
this purpose have been $255,000 for the fiscal year 1912, $60,000 for
1913 and $200,000 for 1914. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href=
"#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span></p>
<p>When we came to the islands, malaria was killing as many persons as
was smallpox. The mortality caused by it is now being greatly reduced
by giving away annually millions of doses of quinine, and by draining
or spraying with petroleum places where mosquitoes breed, as well as by
teaching the people the importance of sleeping under mosquito nets and
the necessity of keeping patients suffering from active attacks of
malaria where mosquitoes cannot get at them. Only quinine of
established quality is allowed in the market.</p>
<p>The results obtained in combating malaria are often very striking.
Calapan, the capital of Mindoro, was in Spanish days known as
&ldquo;the white man&rsquo;s grave&rdquo; on account of the prevalence
of &ldquo;pernicious fever&rdquo; there. To-day it is an exceptionally
healthy provincial town.</p>
<p>At Iwahig, in Palawan, the Spaniards attempted to conduct a penal
colony. They were compelled to abandon it on account of pernicious
malaria, which caused continued serious mortality when the American
government attempted to establish a similar institution there.
Application of the usual sanitary measures has made it a healthful
place.</p>
<p>Old jails throughout the islands have been rendered sanitary, or
replaced by new ones. The loathsome skin diseases from which prisoners
formerly suffered have in consequence disappeared. The practical
results obtained in Bilibid, the insular penitentiary, are worthy of
special note. The annual death rate at this institution was 78.25 per
thousand for the calendar year 1904. It increased steadily each month
from January, 1904, to September, 1905, when it reached its maximum,
deaths occurring at the rate of 241.15 per thousand per year. At this
time the director of health was given charge of the sanitation of this
prison.</p>
<p>By remedying overcrowding, improving drainage, installing sewers and
regulating diet along scientific lines, the rate was reduced in six
months to 70 per 1000, and there it stuck. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span></p>
<p>A systematic examination of the stools of prisoners was then made.
Eighty-four per cent were found to be afflicted with at least one
intestinal parasite. Fifty per cent had two or more, and twenty per
cent had three or more. Fifty-two per cent of the total had hookworm.
Active treatment for the elimination of these parasites was begun in
one barrack, and after the work was completed it was noted that there
was much less disease there than in the remainder. All of the
thirty-five hundred prisoners were ultimately examined, and intestinal
parasites eradicated if present. The death rate then dropped to
thirteen to the thousand, and has remained at or near this figure up to
the present time.</p>
<p>I have already referred to the discovery of the cause of beri-beri,
and to the effect of the governor-general&rsquo;s order forbidding the
use of polished rice in government institutions or by government
organizations.</p>
<p>I subsequently made a strong effort to secure legislation imposing a
heavy internal revenue tax on polished rice, thus penalizing its use. I
failed, but such effort will be renewed by some one, let us hope with
ultimate success.</p>
<p>In Spanish days cholera, leprosy, smallpox and other dangerous
communicable diseases were constantly reintroduced from without. This
is no longer the case. The United States public health and marine
hospital service has stretched an effective defensive line around the
archipelago and has sent its outposts to Hongkong, Shanghai and Amoy,
to prevent, so far as possible, the embarkation for Manila of persons
suffering from such ailments. We now have the most effective quarantine
system in the tropics, and one of the best in the world. At Mariveles
there is a very large and complete disinfecting plant, and vessels may
also be satisfactorily disinfected at Ceb&uacute; and Iloilo.</p>
<p>This quarantine service kept the Philippines free from bubonic
plague for seven years, and has repeatedly prevented the entry of
pneumonic plague, that most deadly of all known diseases. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span></p>
<p>A peculiar and shockingly disfiguring disease known as yaws occurs
somewhat infrequently in the Philippine lowlands and is very prevalent
in a number of places in the highlands. In many ways it resembles
syphilis, and indeed at one time was considered to be syphilitic in its
origin. Doctor Richard P. Strong, of the Bureau of Science, made the
very important discovery that salvarsan is an absolute specific for it.
The effect of an injection of this remedy closely approaches a miracle
in medicine. In five or six days the condition of the patient begins to
improve rapidly. By the end of the second week his horrible sores have
healed.</p>
<p>It was with this remedy that we began our health work among some of
the wilder head-hunters of northern Luz&oacute;n. Think of the
advantage of being absolutely certain of curing such an ailment in
every case, and think of the gratitude of poor wretches, undergoing
untold suffering, when they were almost immediately relieved!</p>
<p>Soon after this use for salvarsan was discovered, I caused a liberal
supply of it to be sent to the Bontoc Hospital. For some time we were
unable to persuade any victims of yaws to undergo treatment, but
finally we found one at Barlig who was guilty of a minor criminal
offence, arrested him, and took him to Bontoc. Instead of putting him
in jail there, we sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At first he complained bitterly that we were putting no medicine on
his sores. Then the remedy began to work and he decided it was
&ldquo;strong medicine.&rdquo; By the tenth day he was running around
town joyfully exhibiting his rapidly healing body to every one who
would look at it. On the fourteenth day he suddenly disappeared, to the
deep regret of the medical men, who had hoped that they might keep him
as an example of what could be done, and thus persuade others to
undergo treatment. A few days later, however, he reappeared with
thirteen victims of yaws from his home town, having meanwhile
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>twice covered on foot the great distance which
separates Barlig from Bontoc, and assembled and brought in his
fellow-sufferers.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the people of Manila were formerly supplied with
impure drinking water from the Mariquina River, and were therefore in
constant danger of infection with cholera and other deadly diseases. At
a cost of some $1,500,000 we have given the city a modern water system,
the intake of which is far up in the hills above the last village. The
annual deaths from ordinary water-borne diseases exclusive of cholera
have fallen from 3558&mdash;the average number at the time the new
system was introduced&mdash;to 1195. Recently a leak in the dam, which
necessitated temporary resumption of the use of the Mariquina River
water, was immediately followed by a marked increase in the number of
deaths from such diseases, thus conclusively demonstrating the fact
that we were right in ascribing the previous reduction in deaths to a
better water supply.</p>
<p>This annual saving of lives is an important result, but more
important yet is the fact that when Asiatic cholera reappears in the
Mariquina valley, as it inevitably will sooner or later, we shall not
live in constant fear of a general infection of the Manila water
supply, which, judging from the experience of other cities where modern
sanitary methods have been introduced, might result in the death of a
third of the population. In every country a very considerable part of
the population always fails to boil its drinking water, no matter how
great the resulting danger may be.</p>
<p>Manila lacked any facilities for the proper disposal of human waste,
and the conditions which resulted were unspeakable, especially in the
little <i>barrios</i>, or groups of houses, placed close together,
helter-skelter, on wet, swampy ground and reached by means of runways
not worthy even of the name of alleys, as one often had to crouch to
pass along them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432"
name="pb432">432</a>]</span></p>
<p>A modern sewer system costing $2,000,000, supplemented by a pail
system, has very effectively solved this problem, while thousands of
homes closely crowded on disease-infected, mosquito-breeding ground
have been removed to high, dry, sanitary sites. The regions thus
vacated have in many instances been drained, filled, provided with city
water and good streets, and made fit for human occupancy.</p>
<p>The old moat around the city walls was a veritable incubator of
disease. It has been converted into an athletic field where crowds of
people take healthful exercise. The <i lang="es">esteros</i>, or tidal
creeks, reeked with filth. More than twenty miles of such creeks have
been cleaned out, although much still remains to be done to put them in
really satisfactory condition.</p>
<p>There were no regulations covering the construction of buildings,
and it was not unusual to find six or eight persons sleeping in a
closed and unventilated room 10 &times; 8 &times; 8 feet. Manila now
has an excellent sanitary code, and such conditions have been made
unlawful.</p>
<p>The previous woeful lack of hospital facilities has been effectively
remedied. At a cost of approximately a million and quarter pesos we
have built and equipped the great Philippine General Hospital, one of
the most modern institutions of its kind in the world, and by far the
best in the Far East. In it we have very satisfactorily solved the
question of getting sufficient light and air in the tropics without
getting excessive heat. Its buildings are certainly among the very
coolest in the city of Manila, and &ldquo;the hospital smell&rdquo; is
everywhere conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>It is called a three-hundred-bed institution, but as a matter of
fact the ventilation is so admirable that nearly two hundred additional
beds can safely be put in as an emergency measure.</p>
<p>Two hundred and twenty of its beds are free. In them a very large
number of persons are annually given <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb433" href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span>the best of medical
and surgical care. At its free clinic some eighty thousand patients
find relief in the course of a year.</p>
<p>The increase in private hospital facilities has also been
noteworthy. Among the new institutions doing admirable work should be
mentioned the University Hospital, an Episcopal institution; the Mary
J. Johnston Hospital, a Methodist institution; and St. Paul&rsquo;s
Hospital, a Catholic institution. Patients are admitted to all of them
without regard to their religious belief, a policy the liberality of
which must commend itself to all broadminded persons.</p>
<p>In enumerating the hospitals of Manila, the old Spanish institution,
San Juan de Dios, should not be forgotten, for it has been improved and
modernized until it offers good facilities for the treatment of the
sick and the injured.</p>
<p>All of the above mentioned institutions are in effect acute-case
hospitals designed for the treatment of curable ailments. Cases of
dangerous communicable disease are excluded from them, but are
adequately provided for at San Lazaro where the insular government has
established modern and adequate hospitals for plague, smallpox,
cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, etc., as well as a
detention hospital for lepers, pending their departure for Culion.</p>
<p>An insane hospital capable of comfortably accommodating 300 inmates
has also been provided. A few years since the insane were commonly
chained to floors, or tied to stakes under houses or in yards, and were
not infrequently burned alive during conflagrations. Such conditions no
longer exist, but the government is not yet able to provide for nearly
all of the insane who need institutional care.</p>
<p>The several institutions above mentioned have a very important
function apart from the relief of human suffering, in that they afford
unexcelled opportunities for giving <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb434" href="#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>practical instruction
in nursing and in the practice of medicine and surgery.</p>

</div>
<p>A few years ago there was not such a thing as a Filipina trained
nurse in the islands. I was firmly convinced that the Filipinas of this
country could learn to be good nurses, and made earnest efforts to have
included among the first students sent at government expense to the
United States several young women of good family who should attend
nurses&rsquo; training schools and then return to assist in our
hospital work.</p>
<p>I failed to secure the adoption of this plan, but later the training
of nurses was inaugurated in connection with hospital work at the old
Civil Hospital, St. Paul&rsquo;s, the University Hospital, the Mary J.
Johnston Hospital and the Philippine General Hospital. At the latter
institution there is now conducted an admirable school where more than
two hundred young men and women are being trained. Three classes have
already graduated from it, and Filipina nurses have long since proved
themselves to be exceptionally efficient, capable and faithful. It will
be some time before we can educate as many as are needed in the
government hospitals, and after that has been accomplished a vast field
opens before others in the provincial towns, where the need of trained
assistants in caring for the sick is very great.</p>
<p>We found exceedingly few competent Filipino physicians or surgeons
in the islands. This condition was due not to natural incompetence on
the part of the Filipinos but to the previous lack of adequate
educational facilities. The government has established a thoroughly
modern college of medicine and surgery, well housed, and provided with
all necessary laboratory facilities. It furnishes the best of
theoretical instruction, while its students have every opportunity for
practical work at the bedsides of patients in the government hospitals,
all patients in free beds being admitted subject to the condition that
they will allow their cases to be studied. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span></p>
<p>While there is still an evident tendency on the part of graduates of
this school to feel that they know enough, and to desire to get to
making money without delay, we are nevertheless managing to attract an
increasingly large number of the more competent to the intern service
of the Philippine General Hospital, where as the result of additional
years of practical experience they become exceptionally proficient.</p>
<p>This institution, with its great free clinic, offers very
exceptional facilities for practical instruction, and we have already
trained some extremely competent Filipino physicians and surgeons.</p>
<p>As funds permit, hospital work is being extended to the provinces.
At Ceb&uacute; a thoroughly up-to-date sixty-bed institution is now
open. A smaller one was established years ago at Baguio, where surgical
work may be performed with great advantage on account of the rapidity
with which convalescence occurs in the cool, pure mountain air, which
also expedites the recovery of persons recuperating from wasting
diseases.</p>
<p>A little more than a year ago a hospital was opened at Bontoc, the
demand for accommodations being so great from the start that we did not
even await the arrival of beds. Sick Igorots were only too glad to lie
on the floor if their needs could be ministered to.</p>
<p>It had previously been the custom of the wild men to kill chickens,
pigs or carabaos in case of illness, in order to propitiate evil
spirits, the kind and number of animals killed being of course
determined by the wealth of the patients. They have now satisfied
themselves that quinine for malaria, salvarsan for yaws, and other
effective remedies for common ailments are more useful and more readily
obtained than was the helpful intervention of the <i>an&iacute;tos,</i>
or spirits of the dead, while the methods and results of modern surgery
are a source of unending amazement and satisfaction to them.</p>
<p>The first surgeon to anesthetize a Kalinga became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>promptly and widely known as &ldquo;the man who
kills people and brings them to life again,&rdquo; and the individual
on whom he operated successfully, who chanced to be the most
influential chief of the tribe, became his friend for life. Indeed, the
results of medical and surgical work for the wild men have been an
important factor in bringing about and maintaining friendly relations
with them.</p>
<p>Their gratitude is at times very touching. At Atok, in Benguet,
there lives an Igorot chief named Palasi. When he was already old a son
was born to him. This boy, who was the delight of his declining years,
became deathly ill with confluent smallpox, and the Igorots considered
him as good as dead. At this time Sanitary Inspector Baron appeared on
the scene. He promptly turned every one else out of the house and
himself nursed the boy, saving his life. Palasi wished to pay him for
his services, but was informed by Mr. Baron that the government paid
him, and he could not accept additional compensation. Palasi promptly
made the long journey to Baguio to ascertain whether Baron had told him
the truth, and was informed by Governor Pack that this was the case.
The old man retired to Atok, quite disgusted with the strange ways of
Americans.</p>
<p>Six months later he again appeared at Baguio to ask the governor
about a <i>fiesta</i> which he had just heard it was customary to
celebrate on the 25th of December. He had been told that Americans were
in the habit of giving presents to each other at this time, and asked
if this was the ease. Governor Pack said yes. Palasi then inquired if
the feast was a <i>good</i> feast, and the custom a <i>good</i> custom,
and was assured that both of these things were true. He next asked if
it would be a good feast for Igorots as well as for Americans, and
receiving an affirmative reply from the unsuspecting governor,
triumphantly declared that he was going to give Baron his best horse.
Under the circumstances the governor allowed him to do so. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name="pb437">437</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with the Bontoc Hospital we use two men, one of whom
travels from settlement to settlement, relieving minor ailments on the
spot and sending to the hospital only those patients who need to go
there, while the other stays at home and receives them. From time to
time these two doctors &ldquo;change works.&rdquo; Pages from their
daily journals, written in the field, often read like romance.</p>
<p>Were I a young man, and possessed of adequate knowledge of medicine
and surgery, I would ask nothing better than to minister to the wants
of these people. One might not, and indeed would not, acquire great
wealth, but he would be rich in friends. Here lies a great field for
practical missionary work.</p>
<p>In connection with the health work there have been many occurrences
which were both amusing and sad. At one time there was great excitement
over a sacred spring which had appeared in Manila Bay off the district
of Tondo. It was duly blessed by Aglipay, the head of the so-called
Aglipayano church. Coincidently with its discovery there was a sharp
little outbreak of Asiatic cholera. Investigation revealed the fact
that the &ldquo;spring&rdquo; had its origin in a broken sewer pipe. We
were obliged to prevent the faithful from further partaking of its
waters, and thus insuring themselves a speedy trip to the better
world.</p>
<p>At one time cases of cholera appeared scattered generally throughout
the Mariquina valley and without apparent connection. For some days we
were unable to make a guess as to their origin. Then we heard that a
&ldquo;Queen&rdquo; had arisen at the town of Taytay near the Laguna de
Bay. An investigation of the Queen and her activities resulted in
rather astonishing revelations. She was a very ordinary looking
Tag&aacute;log girl who had secured the body of an old bull-cart,
stopped the cracks with clay, partially filled it with water and
decaying vegetable matter, and at rather frequent intervals had bathed
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>the fermenting mass thus concocted. In due time
she announced herself a healer of all the ills to which flesh is heir,
and the sick flocked to her. Cholera was then prevalent in some of the
towns near Taytay, and there were persons suffering from it among those
seeking relief. Some of them were directed to wash their hands in the
extemporized tank, while others bathed their bodies in it. As a result
it soon contained a cholera culture of unprecedented richness. This was
given to patients applying for treatment, and was bottled and sent to
those who were too ill to come in person. Hence numerous scattering
cases of cholera which did not bear any relationship to other known
cases.</p>
<p>It proved quite an undertaking to put the Queen of Taytay out of
business. We first asked the local authorities to have her sent to
Manila, but the presidente and the police declined to act. We then
applied for a warrant to the Filipino judge of the court of first
instance having jurisdiction over Taytay, but that worthy official
found it convenient to be suddenly called out of the province. At last
we prevailed upon soldiers of the Philippine constabulary to arrest the
queen and bring her to Manila.</p>
<p>We had anticipated that she might prove insane, but she showed
herself to be a very keen-witted young woman. We employed her at the
San Lazaro Hospital to look after cholera patients. The people of
Taytay were not satisfied, and a few days later a large delegation of
them came to Manila and demanded the Queen. I was at my wits&rsquo; end
to know what to do, but old Spanish law can usually be relied upon in
emergencies, and the attorney-general discovered a provision couched in
very general terms, which provided against disobedience to the
authorities. It was only necessary for an &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to
have read to an ordinary person a statement setting forth what that
person must not do; then if the order was violated, such person could
be made to suffer pains and penalties.</p>
<p>I accordingly prepared a most impressive order prohibiting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>the Queen of Taytay from further engaging in the
practice of medicine, had her followers drawn up in battalion
formation, placed myself at the front and centre, caused the Queen to
be brought before me, and read her my communication, at the same time
charging the good people of Taytay not to tempt her again to try her
hand at healing, for the reason that if they did she would surely get
into serious trouble. They marched away with the Queen and I have not
heard of her since.</p>
<p>Hardly a year goes by that some similar miraculous healer does not
set up in business, and the supply of dupes seems to be unending.</p>
<p>While it is comparatively easy to combat disease in a place like
Manila, what of the provinces, where in many cases there is not one
physician to two hundred thousand inhabitants?</p>
<p>To meet this difficulty we have an organization of district and
municipal health officers. A district may include a single province or
several provinces. A district health officer is invariably a physician
who has had reasonably thorough practical training in the work of
public sanitation, usually at Manila.</p>
<p>He is supposed to spend his time in sanitary work rather than in
treating sick individuals, but it is, of course, impossible for him
always to refuse to treat such persons, and we encourage gratuitous
work for the poor when it can be carried on without interfering too
seriously with more important duties.</p>
<p>Presidents of municipal boards of health may exercise jurisdiction
over a single municipality or over several. They are supposed to
maintain good sanitary conditions in their respective towns, under the
general supervision of district health officers, and to instruct their
people in sanitary methods and their results, as well as to devote a
certain amount of their time to the relief of the suffering poor.</p>
<p>On the whole it must be admitted that while this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=
"pb440">440</a>]</span>system has accomplished much, it has fallen far
short of accomplishing what it should.</p>
<p>Men like Dr. Arlington Pond of Ceb&uacute; have wrought marvels, and
have conclusively demonstrated the fact that it is not the system that
is at fault. Of our thirteen district health officers, ten are
Filipinos. They are, with few exceptions, letter-perfect. They know
what they ought to do, but as a rule lack the initiative and the
courage to do it.</p>
<p>Recently after discovering exceptionally bad sanitary conditions in
several towns of the province of Misamis, I demanded an explanation of
the district health officer, an exceptionally well-educated and
intelligent Filipino physician. I found, as I had anticipated, that the
sanitary regulations of his towns left little to be desired, but that
they were absolutely ignored.</p>
<p>I asked him what sense there was in paying his salary if he failed
to remedy such conditions as I had discovered. He replied that if he
were really going to compel people to clean up, it would be necessary
to begin with the provincial governor, whose premises were in a bad
state. When I suggested that in my opinion the provincial governor
would be the best possible man to begin with, the doctor evidently
thought me crazy!</p>
<p>It is as yet impossible for the average intelligent Filipino to
understand that the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak,
should be treated alike.</p>
<p>It often happens that a province asks for an American health
officer, or a Filipino demands the services of an American physician.
My invariable procedure in such cases has been to request that the
application be made in writing. For some mysterious reason the
petitioners are seldom willing to go on record.</p>
<p>A short time since we had a strong demand from Iloilo for an
American district health officer. I made the usual suggestion and got a
written request that there be sent to Iloilo a district health officer
&ldquo;after the style <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href=
"#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>of the district health officer of
Ceb&uacute;.&rdquo; If Dr. Pond&rsquo;s nationality may be considered a
part of his style, then this was a request for an American, otherwise
not!</p>
<p>With rather shocking frequency, Filipinos who must be examined for
leprosy or some other dangerous communicable disease strongly insist
that the examination be made by an American bacteriologist rather than
by one of their own countrymen.</p>
<p>In connection with recent election troubles two men were wrongfully
denounced as lepers. In several instances perfectly sound people have
been thrust among lepers who were being taken on board steamer for
transfer to Culion. This grievous wrong was committed by their enemies
under cover of darkness, and in the confusion which attends the
embarking of a number of people in a heavy sea. The reason why the
services of Americans are often specially requested for diagnostic work
is not far to seek!</p>
<p>It is a significant fact that our greatest success in establishing
satisfactory provincial sanitary conditions has been achieved in
certain of the &ldquo;special government provinces,&rdquo; where the
people are under the very direct control of American officials.</p>
<p>There is not a regularly organized province in the Philippines in
which the towns are as clean as are those of Mindoro, where, until
recently, we have never had a resident district health officer.</p>
<p>I believe that nowhere in the tropics can there be found native
towns which are cleaner or more healthful than are those of Bukidnon,
inhabited in some instances by people who have literally been brought
down out of the tree-tops within the last two or three years. We have
never had a resident health officer in this subprovince.</p>
<p>I mention these facts not as an argument against health officers,
but as a proof of what can be done without them by intelligent
Americans vested with proper authority.</p>

<p>It has given me especial pleasure to see the fundamental change
which has come about in public sentiment relative to medical, surgical
and sanitary work. At the outset sanitary inspectors and vaccinators
carried on their work at serious risk of personal violence. Indeed,
several of them were killed. Incredible tales were believed by the
populace, with the result that cholera victims sometimes had to be
taken to the hospital by force. In later years it has been by no means
unusual for them to come in voluntarily and request treatment.</p>
<p>General hospitals were in the old days regarded as places where
people so unfortunate as to have no homes to die in might go to end
their days. It was almost impossible to get any other class of persons
into them.</p>
<p>Now we constantly turn away deserving patients from the Philippine
General Hospital because of lack of room. The common people are
flocking to it in rapidly increasing numbers. We even have
&ldquo;repeaters,&rdquo; and persons who drop in just to get a
comfortable bed and a bath while waiting for an examination which will
inevitably show that there is nothing wrong with them.</p>
<p>Our difficulties were increased at the outset by the fact that many
foreign medical men working in the Far East good-naturedly ridiculed
our efforts to better conditions, claiming that in tropical colonies it
was customary to take only such steps as would safeguard the health of
European residents, and that it was really best to let the masses live
as they would, since orientals were incapable of sanitary reform, and
the attempt to bring it about involved a waste of effort that might be
more profitably directed elsewhere. Furthermore these men were, in
their several countries, practising what they preached.</p>
<p>It has been very interesting to note the reaction of American
methods upon those previously in vogue in neighbouring colonies. At
first our efforts to make Asiatics clean up, and to eliminate diseases
like leprosy, cholera and plague, were viewed with mild amusement,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>not unmixed with contempt; but the results which
we obtained soon aroused lively interest.</p>
<p>Foreign governments began to send representatives to the annual
meetings of the &ldquo;Philippine Island Medical
Association,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11143src" href=
"#xd26e11143" name="xd26e11143src">7</a> in order to learn more of our
methods. From these small beginnings sprang &ldquo;The Far Eastern
Association of Tropical Medicine,&rdquo; the biennial meetings of which
bring together the most experienced, skilful and widely known
physicians and sanitarians in the East for an interchange of views and
experiences which is invaluable, and greatly facilitates concerted
action between the various governments concerned in dealing with what
may be termed &ldquo;international health problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first meeting of this Association was held at Manila, the second
at Hongkong. The third will take place at Saigon.</p>
<p>The results of a rigid enforcement of the &ldquo;Pure Food and Drugs
Act&rdquo; are worthy of more than passing notice. Such enforcement has
been comparatively easy as the officials concerned are not hampered by
politics. The Philippines were at one time a dumping-ground for
products that could not be sold elsewhere, but it is now possible for
Filipinos to obtain wholesome preserved foods and unadulterated drugs,
except in very remote places where none of any sort are available.</p>
<p>The cost of our medical and sanitary work has been comparatively
small. The per capita rate of taxation here is lower than in any other
civilized country. What we have done has been accomplished without
spending vast sums of money or resorting to military measures.</p>
<p>The results obtained are very largely due to the faithfulness and
efficiency of Dr. Victor G. Heiser, who was chief quarantine officer of
the Philippines when he succeeded Major E. C. Carter as commissioner of
public <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>health on April 5, 1905, and was later made
director of health when the original board of health was abolished as
an administrative entity. He has continued to hold the office of chief
quarantine officer, and thus has been in complete executive control of
the health situation for eight years.</p>
<p>Through good report and ill, mostly ill, he has given unsparingly of
his time, his skill and his wisdom, always treating the government
money as if it were his own.</p>
<p>His tenure of office has been long enough to enable him to
inaugurate and carry out policies, and thus get results.</p>
<p>Seldom, if ever, have health officials been more viciously and
persistently attacked than have Dr. Heiser and myself. The assaults on
us have been the direct result of a firm stand for a new sanitary order
of things, established in the interest of the whole body of inhabitants
of these islands, civilized and uncivilized. We both welcome the
profound change in public sentiment, which has slowly but surely come
about as a result of practical accomplishment.</p>
<p>Many very grave health problems still confront the insular
administration. Of these the most serious are the eradication of
tuberculosis and the reduction of the very high infant mortality
rate.</p>
<p>It is believed that about one Filipino in five suffers from
tuberculosis in some form during his life and the work we have thus far
accomplished in many fields must be considered as in a way a clearing
of the decks for action against this, the greatest enemy of all.
However, the Philippines do not differ essentially from other civilized
countries, in all of which tuberculosis is a very serious factor in the
death rate.</p>
<p>As regards infant mortality the situation is different. More than
fifty per cent of the babes die before completing their first year of
life. The causes which lead to this appalling result have been made the
subject of careful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445"
name="pb445">445</a>]</span>investigation which still continues.
Popular interest has been aroused, but it is undoubtedly true that many
years of patient work will be necessary before anything approaching
satisfactory results can be brought about.</p>
<p>The physical condition of the average Filipino is undoubtedly bad.
Of one hundred seventy-eight university students recently examined
sixty-nine were found to be suffering from serious organic troubles.
Unquestionably the great mass of the people are underfed. This is
largely due to the poor quality of the rice which they consume, and to
the fact that rice forms too large a part of their diet. I am firmly
convinced that much of the so-called laziness of the Filipinos is the
direct result of physical weakness due to improper and insufficient
food.</p>
<p>Since the American occupation a large amount of time has been
successfully devoted to the working out of a good all-around diet made
up of local products the cost of which comes within the means of the
poor. The next thing will be to get them to adopt it, and there comes
the rub. Incalculable good would result, if we could only persuade the
people of these islands to sleep with their windows open. Thousands
upon thousands of infant lives would be saved annually, if mothers
could be persuaded not to give solid food to their little ones during
the early months of their existence.</p>
<p>In the educational campaign which we have thus far conducted with
some considerable degree of success, two agencies have proved
invaluable, namely the Catholic Church and the public schools. Again
and again I have begged Apostolic Delegate Monsignor Agius and
Archbishop Harty to bring to bear the influence of the Church in favour
of simple sanitary regulations, the general adoption of which was
imperatively necessary in combating some epidemic of disease. They have
invariably given me invaluable assistance.</p>
<p>Through the public schools we reach more than half a million
children, and they take the information which we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>convey to them home to their parents. Simple
rules for the prevention of cholera have been universally taught in the
schools. When the use of English has become generalized the difficulty
now encountered in reaching the common people will largely disappear.
The truth is that they are singularly tractable and docile when their
reason can be effectively appealed to. The readiness with which they
have submitted to the rigorous measures necessary for the elimination
of leprosy is a lasting honour to them.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Typical Negrito</p>
<p class="first">The people of this tribe of woolly-headed blacks are
believed to be the aborignes of the Philippines. Only about twenty-five
thousand of them remain.</p>
</div>
<p>Would the sanitary campaign so vitally important to the people of
the Philippines be effectively continued if American authority were
withdrawn at this time? With regret I must answer this question
emphatically in the negative. We have succeeded in training a few good
physicians and surgeons. We have thus far failed to train really
efficient sanitary officers. What is lacking is not so much knowledge
as to what should be done as initiative and courage to do it. Until
this condition changes radically for the better, Filipinos cannot
safely be intrusted with the sanitary regeneration of their country.
Under American control the population of the islands is steadily and
rapidly increasing. It is my firm conviction that if Filipinos were at
this time placed in control of the health work, the population would
steadily and rapidly decrease.</p>
<p>The present attitude of the Filipino press toward sanitary work is
both interesting and important. I quote the following editorial from
the March 27, 1913, issue of <i>El Ideal</i>, a paper generally
believed to be controlled by Speaker Osme&ntilde;a:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Some persons, who, because of being ignorant of
many things, do not sympathize with the Filipino people, who are in the
habit of frequently throwing up to them the violent opposition of our
masses to strict sanitary measures in cases of epidemics, and the
lively protests which are provoked here on some occasions by other
provisions tending to end some public calamity, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>thinking they see in this disposition of mind an
indication of our incapacity to govern ourselves&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be more expressive, we shall say that the sanitary agents
and veterinarians of the government, swollen with power and overly
zealous of their prestige, quickly become, when an occasion like those
cited by us presents itself, cunning czars, whose sphere of influence
is in direct ratio to the peaceful character and ignorance of the
people intrusted to their care, and whose excesses and abuses recognize
no limits but the natural ones established by the greater or lesser
honour of those public servants, their greater or lesser cynicism, and
their greater or lesser degree of temerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, and nothing else, is the logical and natural
explanation of the hostility of our people toward those measures of
good government which are sincerely esteemed for what they are worth,
but for which they have veritable terror because of the nameless abuses
to which they give rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These comments are of palpitating current interest at this
moment, when reports are made almost daily to the press and the proper
authorities of misbehaviour and excesses befitting soulless people who
live without the law committed by persons who should be examples of
prudence, honesty and good manners, for it is in this concept that the
people are compelled to furnish them their daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is deeply to be regretted that the public press of the islands
has not yet become sufficiently enlightened to join in the great
sanitary campaign which has already relieved an enormous amount of
human suffering and has greatly increased the expectancy of life of the
people of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Philippine Assembly has repeatedly passed acts providing for the
creation of a sort of sanitary council of numerous members authorized
to pass on public health measures proposed by the director of health
and instructed to disapprove them if not in accordance with the beliefs
and customs of the Filipinos.</p>
<p>In protecting the public health in the Philippine Islands
emergencies constantly arise which must be instantly and effectively
met. It would be as logical to place a commanding general directing a
battle under the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448"
name="pb448">448</a>]</span>control of an advisory board as it would
thus to tie the hands of the director of health, and it is difficult to
see how any competent and self-respecting sanitarian could be willing
to continue to hold this position if so hampered.</p>
<p>The Philippine Commission has heretofore invariably tabled the acts
designed to accomplish this end, but that body has now been
&ldquo;Filipinized&rdquo; and its future attitude on this very
important question is therefore in doubt. Hardly had the legislative
session opened in October, 1913, when the assembly again passed the
same old bill. Should it become a law, there will be occasion to watch,
with especial interest, the death rate of Manila and that of the
archipelago as a whole. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Baguio and the Benguet Road</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In June, 1892, when sitting in a native house on a
hill overlooking Naujan Lake in Mindoro, and anxiously awaiting the
boats which were to make it possible for my party to return to the
coast, I saw a small flotilla approaching.</p>
<p>To my surprise and regret I found that it was not coming for us, but
brought a number of Spanish officers who had heard that we had some
mysterious procedure for killing the tamarau, an extraordinarily wild
and vicious little buffalo peculiar to this island. They had come to
get us to tell them how we did it, if possible, and if not to watch us
and find out for themselves.</p>
<p>We described to them our method, which was easily understood. It
consisted in picking up a likely trail along some water course,
following it until the tamarau was overtaken, and then shooting him.
This looked suspiciously simple to our Spanish friends before they had
tried it, and they shook their heads. After trying it they became
convinced that more than a few days of experience would be necessary
before satisfactory results could be obtained. They profited little by
the best information we could give them, and by the services of the
expert tracker whom we loaned to them. Meanwhile I obtained from one of
them, Se&ntilde;or Domingo Sanchez, information destined to become of
great importance in the development of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Sanchez, who was an employee of the Spanish forestry
bureau, told me that in the highlands of Northern Luz&oacute;n at an
elevation of about five thousand feet, there was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>a
region of pines and oaks blessed with a perpetually temperate climate
and even with occasional frosts. I confess that I did not believe all
of his statements. I was then experienced in climbing Philippine
mountains, and at five thousand feet had invariably found a hopeless
tangle of the rankest tropical vegetation, with humidity so high that
trees were draped with ferns, orchids, and thick moss, and dripping
with moisture. However, I knew that the mere presence of pine and oak
trees would mean the occurrence of special bird species feeding upon
their seeds, and so determined to investigate.</p>
<p>A severe attack of typhoid fever necessitated my leaving the islands
before I could carry out this plan, but upon my return with the first
Philippine Commission in 1899 I remembered Se&ntilde;or Sanchez&rsquo;s
story. In view of the probability that American occupation would
continue for a long period, the existence or non-existence near Manila
of an extensive highland region with a temperate climate became a
question of great practical importance. I therefore caused search to be
made in the Spanish archives to see what, if any, reliable information
was available, and to my great satisfaction unearthed a detailed report
made by a committee of three distinguished and competent Spanish
officers who had spent some weeks at Baguio in the <i>comandancia</i>
of Benguet, during which period they had made six temperature
observations daily, had tramped over the neighbouring country very
thoroughly, had located a number of springs of potable water and
determined their approximate flow, and in short had gathered a large
series of very valuable data which more than bore out the statements of
Se&ntilde;or Sanchez.</p>
<p>I found, furthermore, that Spanish engineers had made a survey for a
carriage road into this country, and had prepared a profile of it with
estimates of the amount and cost of the necessary excavation and other
work.</p>
<p>While in Washington during the winter of 1899&ndash;1900, I brought
this matter to the attention of Secretary Root. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name="pb451">451</a>]</span>Just
as the second Philippine Commission was filing out of his office, after
receiving its instructions, he called out to us directing that we look
into that Benguet matter, and if the facts proved to be as stated open
up the country.</p>
<p>Mindful of these instructions the commission delegated General Luke
E. Wright and myself to visit Benguet and familiarize ourselves with
conditions by investigation on the ground. General MacArthur was
dubious when we expressed a desire to carry out the instructions of the
secretary of war. He told us that the country was very dangerous,
doubtless confusing it with Bangued, the capital of Abra, near which
there was at that time a strong and active Insurgent force.</p>
<p>We insisted on going, so he said that he would send a troop of
cavalry with us, and he kept his word. During the last week of July we
finally sailed from Manila on a naval vessel for San Fernando in the
province of Union. From this place we expected to go by road as far as
Naguilian, in the same province, and thence on horseback to Trinidad
and Baguio, in Benguet.</p>
<p>In order to expedite investigations as much as possible we took with
us Mr. Horace L. Higgins, president of the Manila and Dagupan Railway
Company, who was an engineer of experience, to report on the
practicability of constructing a railway to Baguio. We also took Major
L. M. Maus, of the army medical corps, and Dr. Frank S. Bourns, who
then held the volunteer rank of major in the same corps, to report on
the possibilities of the place as a health resort. Two young naval
officers went along just for the trip.</p>
<p>Major Maus accompanied us only because requested to do so. Taking
the latitude and altitude as a basis for his calculations, he had
already determined with a lead pencil and piece of paper just what the
climate of Baguio must be, and had demonstrated to his own complete
satisfaction that the statements of the members of the Spanish
committee above referred to were necessarily false.</p>

<p>His first rude shock came when we were met at San Fernando by a
young aide to Colonel<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11264src" href=
"#xd26e11264" name="xd26e11264src">1</a> Duval, who was in command of
the local garrison at that place. This lieutenant told us that some
negro soldiers were stationed at Trinidad and were being kept supplied
by an army pack train. I asked him how they were getting on. He said
very well, except that they could not keep warm. They had called for
all the spare blankets available, but still complained of the cold!</p>
<p>The trail proved to be in execrable condition. No repair work had
been done on it since 1896, and its constant use during the
then-existing rainy season by a pack train had completed its
destruction. Much of the way it was a mere V in the earth, with deep
mud at the bottom.</p>
<p>We left Naguilian early in the morning and stopped for lunch at a
little place properly called Sabl&aacute;n, but unofficially known as
&ldquo;The Bells.&rdquo; Aguinaldo had thought at one time of
establishing his headquarters in Benguet and had planned to have a gun
foundry at Sabl&aacute;n. His troops accordingly stole most of the
church bells in the neighbouring lowland towns, meaning to use them for
gun metal, and compelled the unfortunate Benguet Igorots to carry them
up the steep trail. Boiler pipes, which had been used in lieu of
carrying poles, had in several instances been badly bent out of shape.
There was even an old vertical boiler which had been lugged up entire
for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>The labour involved must have been enormous, and we were assured
that when the Igorot bearers, prostrated with fatigue, had refused to
continue their titanic task without rest, they had been driven to it at
the muzzles of Insurgent rifles, and that some of them had been shot as
a lesson to the others. At all events, the boiler and the bells were
there, and there the boiler and the larger bells have remained ever
since!</p>
<p>It was still steaming hot at Sabl&aacute;n, and the whole
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>countryside was buried in the densest tropical
vegetation. Major Maus was triumphant. Things were working out just as
he had predicted. However, as we were already halfway up, we thought
that we might as well continue the journey. I had expected to find
pines and oaks, but had anticipated that they would grow amidst a dense
tangle of damp tropical vegetation.</p>
<p>We were all literally dumfounded when within the space of a hundred
yards we suddenly left the tropics behind us and came out into a
wonderful region of pine parks. Trees stood on the rounded knolls at
comparatively wide intervals, and there were scores of places where, in
order to have a beautiful house lot, one needed only to construct
driveways and go to work with a lawn-mower. At the same moment, a
delightful cold breeze swept down from the heights above us.</p>
<p>Just at sunset we experienced a second surprise, coming out on the
knife-sharp crest of a ridge, and seeing spread before us the Trinidad
Valley, which is shaped like a huge wash-basin. Its floor was vividly
green with growing rice, Igorot houses were dotted here and there over
its surface, and the whole peaceful, beautiful scene was illuminated by
the rays of the setting sun. The air had been washed clean by the heavy
rain which had poured down on us throughout the afternoon, and the
sight was one never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Just at dusk we reached the little settlement of Trinidad, which had
been the capital of the Spanish <i>comandancia</i> of Benguet, finding
that its inhabitants were in part Ilocanos and in part Igorots.</p>
<p>Here we were hospitably entertained by the officers of the military
post. It was so cold that one&rsquo;s breath showed. Major Maus
improved the opportunity to indulge in a severe chill. Finding him
buried under blankets, we asked his views as to the Benguet climate.
They were radical! It is only fair to the Major to say that the report
which he ultimately made set forth the facts fully and fairly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>It did not suit General MacArthur. Years
afterward, when discussing the climate of Benguet with Surgeon-General
Sternberg, I referred to this report and found to my amazement that he
had never seen it. He caused an investigation to be made, and it was at
last resurrected from a dusty pigeonhole.</p>
<p>On our arrival at Trinidad we received a letter from Mr. Otto
Scheerer, the one white resident of Benguet, inviting us to make our
headquarters at his house when we visited Baguio. Bright and early the
next morning Mr. Scheerer himself appeared on the scene and guided us
to his home, where he entertained us most hospitably during our entire
stay. The trip from Trinidad, a distance of four miles, was made over a
wretched pony trail.</p>
<p>We found conditions exactly as described in the Spanish report. The
country was gently rolling, its elevation ranging from forty-five
hundred to fifty-two hundred feet. The hills were covered with short,
thick grass, and with magnificent pine trees, which for the most part
grew at considerable distance from each other, while along the streams
there were wonderful tree ferns and luxuriant tangles of beautiful
tropical vegetation. It took us but a short time to decide that here
was an ideal site for a future city, if water could be found in
sufficient quantity.</p>
<p>We revisited each of the several springs discovered and described by
the Spanish committee, but decided that they would be inadequate to
supply a town of any great size. Mr. Scheerer now came to the front and
guided us to the very thing that we were looking for, but had hardly
dared hope to find; namely, a magnificent spring of crystal-clear
water. At that time it was flowing nearly a million gallons per day. It
burst forth from a hillside in such a manner as to make its protection
from surface drainage easy, and we decided that there was nothing
lacking to make Baguio an admirable site for the future summer capital
and health resort of the Philippines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb455" href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was obvious that the construction of a highway from San Fernando,
in Union, to Baguio would involve considerable expense, and we asked
Mr. Scheerer about other possible lines of communication. A study of
the Spanish maps had led us to consider two: one up the valley of the
Agno River, and the other up that of the Bued River. The latter route
had the great advantage of affording direct communication with the end
of the railway line at Dagupan.</p>
<p>Mr. Scheerer took us to a point which commanded a view for some
distance down the Bued River valley, and conditions looked rather
favourable. Mr. Higgins undertook to make a trip down this valley to
the plains of Pangasin&aacute;n, reporting to us on his arrival at
Manila, so we returned to that place and awaited advices from him. He
was furnished with a guard of soldiers from Trinidad, and attempted to
go down the river bed, but encountered unexpected difficulties, and his
progress was finally checked by a box ca&ntilde;on from which he
escaped with difficulty, spending a night without food or water on a
chilly mountain top known as &ldquo;Thumb Peak.&rdquo; The following
morning he managed to cross to a high mountain called Santo
Tom&aacute;s, whence he returned to Baguio. He was, however, of the
opinion that the trip down the ca&ntilde;on could be made without
special difficulty by a party suitably provided with food and
tentage.</p>
<p>Convinced by our report that active measures should be taken to
establish communication with this wonderful region, the commission, on
September 12, 1900, appropriated $5000 Mexican, &ldquo;for the purpose
of making a survey to ascertain the most advantageous route for a
railway into the mountains of Benguet, Island of Luzon, and the
probable cost thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Charles W. Meade, then serving as city engineer of Manila,
was selected to make the survey. There was every theoretical reason to
believe him competent, and we did not question either his integrity or
his ability. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name=
"pb456">456</a>]</span>After being absent from Manila for some time, he
reported in favour of the Bued River valley route, saying that it was
entirely feasible to build a railway along it.</p>
<p>He suggested that, as the construction of a wagon road would be
necessary in building the railroad, we might as well undertake that
first, and so be able to go to Baguio in wheeled vehicles before the
railroad was completed. He asked for $75,000 United States currency,
with which to build this road, stating that he expected to be able to
do it for $65,000, but would like $10,000 as a margin of safety.</p>
<p>On December 21, 1901, the commission passed an act authorizing the
construction of a highway from Pozorubio, in Pangasin&aacute;n, to
Baguio, &ldquo;the same to be built under the general supervision of
the military governor and the immediate direction of Captain Charles W.
Meade, Thirty-sixth Infantry, United States Volunteers, who has been
detailed by the military governor for that purpose, along the general
line of survey recently made by Captain Meade for a railway between
said towns.&rdquo; The $75,000 asked for were appropriated by this
act.</p>
<p>Work began promptly at both ends of the line. In June, 1901, I set
out on my first trip through the wild man&rsquo;s territory in northern
Luz&oacute;n. Incidentally, and for my personal satisfaction only, I
inspected the work on the road. We had been rather disappointed by
Captain Meade&rsquo;s failure to make more rapid progress. At the lower
end I found that delay was being caused by a huge cliff necessitating a
very heavy rock cut. I was assured by Captain Meade that from this
point on the line ran through dirt most of the way, so that the road
could be completed very rapidly. This statement proved to be grossly in
error. It took years of hard work to open up the road.</p>
<p>Its cost when finally ready for traffic was $1,961,847.05. Its
length was forty-five kilometers eight hundred ninety-one
meters,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11317src" href="#xd26e11317" name=
"xd26e11317src">2</a> of which thirty-four kilometers were in
non-Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457</a>]</span>territory. Some ten kilometers of the remainder
have since been incorporated in the first-class road system of the
province of Pangasin&aacute;n, as this part is chiefly used by the
people of that province in shipping their agricultural products to
Benguet, and in maintaining communication between their towns.</p>
<p>The additional cost of the road to date<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11324src" href="#xd26e11324" name="xd26e11324src">3</a> since it
was first opened is $792,434, making its total cost to date
$2,754,281.05. This includes not only the actual cost of maintenance,
but very extensive improvements, such as the metalling of the road from
the so-called zigzag to Baguio, the construction of five steel bridges,
and the replacing of all the original bridges on the road and of all
the original culverts except those made of concrete or masonry.</p>
<p>On my arrival in Benguet in 1901, I found that good progress had
been made on the upper end of the road, which had penetrated for a
short distance into the ca&ntilde;on proper without encountering any
considerable obstacles.</p>
<p>On October 15, 1901, the commission stated in its annual report to
the secretary of war, &ldquo;He<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11331src"
href="#xd26e11331" name="xd26e11331src">4</a> has been much delayed by
the difficulty of procuring the labour necessary for its early
completion, and several months will yet elapse before it is
finished!&rdquo; They did!</p>
<p>On August 20, 1901, Captain Meade was relieved, and Mr. N. M. Holmes
was made engineer of the road.</p>
<p>On February 3, 1902, a little sanitarium was opened in a small
native house at Baguio. During the following July I was sent to it as a
patient, and while in Benguet again inspected the road which had been
continued high up on the ca&ntilde;on wall to a point where, on a very
steep mountain side, a peculiar rock formation had been encountered at
the very grass roots. This rock disintegrated rapidly under the action
of the sun when exposed to it. Comparatively solid in the morning, it
would crack to pieces and slide down the mountain side before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458</a>]</span>night. A sixty-foot cut had already been made
into the precipitous mountain side, and the result was an unstable
road-bed, hardly four feet in width, which threatened to go out at any
moment.</p>
<div class="figure p059width" id="p059"><img src="images/p059.jpg" alt=

<p class="first">This picture shows Lieutenant-Governor Walter F. Hale,

L&uacute;bao to settle amicably a head-hunting feud of long
standing.</p>
</div>
<p>My trip to Baguio promptly relieved a severe attack of acute
intestinal trouble from which I had been suffering, and when Governor
Taft fell ill the following year with a similar ailment, and his
physicians recommended his return to the United States, I did my best
to persuade him to try Baguio instead. He decided to do so.</p>
<p>Five rough cottages had meanwhile been constructed for the use of
the commissioners, the lumber for them being sawed by hand on the
ground. Boards had been nailed to frames as rapidly as they fell from
the logs, and had shrunk to such an extent that a reasonably expert
marksman might almost have thrown a cat by the tail through any one of
the houses. At night they looked like the old-fashioned perforated tin
lanterns, leaking light in a thousand places. These were the luxurious
homes provided for the high officials of the government of which so
much has been said!</p>
<p>We paid for them an annual rental amounting to ten per cent of their
cost, which had of course been excessively high on account of the
necessity of packing everything used in them, except the lumber, up the
Naguilian trail.</p>
<p>However, we were in no frame of mind to be critical. We had put in
three years of killing hard work, labouring seven days in the week, and
keeping hours such as to arouse a feeling little short of horror among
old British and other foreign residents. We were all completely
exhausted, and Mr. Taft was ill. For my part, I would gladly have paid
almost any sum for a tent under the pine trees and the privilege of
occupying it for a few weeks.</p>
<p>On the trip up Mr. Taft had ridden a magnificent saddle horse which
had been given to him by General Chaffee. At the time he left, Manila
had been burning hot. When he was at last seated on the porch of the
little house which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459"
name="pb459">459</a>]</span>was to be his home for weeks, with a cool
breeze sighing through the needles of a spreading pine tree close at
hand, his satisfaction knew no bounds. Already his magnificent
constitution had begun to respond to the stimulation of the wonderful
mountain air, and filled with enthusiasm he summoned a stenographer and
dictated the following cablegram to the secretary of war:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;April 15, 1903.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Secwar</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Washington</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stood trip well, rode horseback 25 miles to 5000 feet
altitude. Hope amoebic dysentery cured. Great province this, only 150
miles from Manila with air as bracing as Adirondacks or Murray Bay.
Only pines and grass lands. Temperature this hottest month in the
Philippines in my cottage porch at three in the afternoon 68. Fires are
necessary night and morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Taft</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As quick as the wires could bring it, he received the following
reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Washington</span>, D.C., April
16, 1903.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Taft</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Manila</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring to telegram from your office of 15th inst., how is
horse?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Root</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he read it his shouts of laughter, rolling over the hills of
Baguio, must have been audible half a mile away!</p>
<p>Mr. Taft&rsquo;s sojourn in the hills put him again in fine
condition and made it possible for him to return to Manila and resume
the heavy burden of work which there awaited him. The other members of
the commission also greatly benefited by their stay in the hills.</p>
<p>While there we heard disquieting rumours as to the practicability of
completing the road. There was a difference of opinion between the
engineer in charge and one of his immediate subordinates as to the
route which should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460"
name="pb460">460</a>]</span>be followed. The consulting engineer of the
commission was accordingly requested to make a survey to determine a
practicable route for the unfinished portion of the road and estimate
the cost of completing it. In due time he advised us that it was
practicable to complete it, but that the cost would be at least
$1,000,000. Warned by our experience with Meade, we wished additional
expert advice, so summoned to Baguio Colonel L. W. V. Kennon, a man of
great energy and executive ability, who had had large experience in
engineering work in mountainous country, and requested him to go down
the Bued River valley and report on the progress of the work, and the
practicability of completing the road on the route which had been
determined upon.</p>
<p>Being the youngest and most active member of the commission, I was
detailed to accompany him. On this trip I became convinced that all of
the engineers interested, except the consulting engineer, had grossly
understated the difficulties which must be overcome before the road
could be completed. Colonel Kennon decided that it was entirely
feasible to build the road, but that the comparatively short stretch
already completed from Baguio into the upper end of the ca&ntilde;on
must be abandoned and a new line adopted. Furthermore, he gave us some
very definite and extremely unpleasant information as to the probable
cost of completing the work, his statements on this subject confirming
those of the consulting engineer.</p>
<p>The commission was thus put face to face with the hard facts but did
not flinch. On the contrary, it passed the following resolution on June
1, 1903:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On Motion, <span class="sc">Resolved</span>,
That it be declared the policy of the Commission to make the town of
Baguio, in the Province of Benguet, the summer capital of the
Archipelago and to construct suitable buildings, to secure suitable
transportation, to secure proper water supply, and to make residence in
Baguio possible for all of the officers and employees of the Insular
Government for four months during the year, that in pursuance of this
purpose the Secretary of the Interior, the Consulting Engineer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name=
"pb461">461</a>]</span>to the Commission, the Chief of the Bureau of
Architecture, and Major<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11427src" href=
"#xd26e11427" name="xd26e11427src">5</a> L. W. V. Kennon, United States
Army, whom it is the intention of the Commission to put in actual
charge of the improvements in Benguet Province, including the
construction of the Benguet Road, the erection of the buildings and the
construction of a wagon road from Naguilian, be appointed a Committee
to report plans and estimates to the Commission for the proposed
improvements in the Province of Benguet and to submit same to the
Commission for action and necessary appropriation, and</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Be it further resolved</span>, That steps
should be immediately taken looking to the increase of the capacity of
the Sanitarium by at least twenty rooms, to the construction of seven
more cottages on the grounds of the Sanitarium, to the construction of
a Governor&rsquo;s residence on the site overlooking the big spring
which is the source of the Bued River immediately south of the
Sanitarium proper, to the construction of an Administration building
sufficient for the Commission, the Commission&rsquo;s staff and the
Executive Bureau, of at least twenty-five rooms, and to the making of a
plan for a town site for the municipality of Baguio; but that the
details of construction and improvements, with such variations from the
indicated plan as may seem wise, shall be left to the committee
appointed under the previous resolution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his annual report dated November 15, 1903, Governor Taft
said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In connection with the subject of health,
reference should be made to the province of Benguet and to Baguio, the
capital of that province. The secretary of commerce and police will
refer to the work now being done in the construction of the Benguet
road from Pozorrubio, through Twin Peaks, to Baguio. There have been
serious engineering mistakes made in the road, and it is proving to be
much more costly than was expected; but when completed its importance
in the development of these islands can hardly be overestimated. One of
the things essential to progress in the islands is the coming of more
Americans and Europeans who shall make this their business home. If
there can be brought within twelve hours&rsquo; travel of Manila a
place with a climate not unlike that of the Adirondacks, or of Wyoming
in summer, it will add greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb462"
href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>to the possibility of living
in Manila for ten months of the year without risk. It will take away
the necessity for long vacations spent in America; will reduce the
number who go invalided home, and will be a saving to the insular
government of many thousands of dollars a year. It will lengthen the
period during which the American soldiers who are stationed here may
remain without injury to their health and will thus reduce largely the
expense of transportation of troops between the islands and the United
States. More than this, Filipinos of the wealthier class frequently
visit Japan or China for the purpose of recuperating. People of this
class are much interested in the establishment of Baguio as a summer
capital, and when the road is completed a town will spring up, made up
of comfortable residences, of a fine, extensive army post, and
sanitariums for the relief of persons suffering from diseases prevalent
in the lowlands. It is the hope of the government that the Roman
Catholic Church will send American priests as it has sent American
bishops to the islands, to assist in the moral elevation of the people.
The fear of the effect of the climate has kept many from coming. The
Roman Catholic Church authorities have announced their intention of
erecting rest houses at Baguio for the purpose of the recuperation of
their ministers and agents. The Methodists and Episcopalians have
already secured building lots in Baguio for this purpose. It is the
settled purpose of the Commission to see this improvement through, no
matter what the cost, because eventually the expenditures must redound
to the benefit of the government and people of the islands. We have
already stated, in the report on the public land act, that it is
proposed, under that act, which allows the organizing of town sites, to
sell the public land in suitable lots at auction so that every one
interested shall have the opportunity to obtain a good lot upon which
to build a suitable house.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11443src"
href="#xd26e11443" name="xd26e11443src">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Taft would be delighted could he see to-day how completely his
anticipations have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Colonel Kennon was put in charge of construction work, and things
began to move. They kept moving until the road was finished. From this
time on we knew that the expense involved would be out of all
proportion to the original estimate, but we were determined to push the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463" name=
"pb463">463</a>]</span>work through, having reached the decision that
it was worth while to open up communication with Baguio at any cost
within reason, because of its future certain value to the people of the
islands as a health resort.</p>
<p>On April 1, 1904, I rode over the road in a vehicle nearly to Camp
Four, and came the rest of the way to Baguio on horseback over a new
trail which zigzagged up a mountain side near Camp Four and followed
the crest of the range from there in. A little later the Commission
came by the same route, and spent the hot season in the cool Benguet
hills.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1905, Colonel Kennon drove into Baguio in the first
wagon to arrive there over the Benguet Road, which was opened for
regular service on March 27th of the same year. The cost of the road on
November 1, 1905, had, as previously stated, been $1,966,847.05, and
the cost of the heavy work in the ca&ntilde;on had been approximately
$75,000 per mile, which is not excessive when compared with the cost of
similar work in the United States, especially as this sum included
maintenance of the portions constructed during previous years.</p>
<p>The fact that a certain amount of congressional relief funds was
expended on the construction of this road has been made the subject of
very unjust criticism. A large number of poor Filipinos, who were in
dire straits, were thus given an opportunity for remunerative
employment, and the distribution of a portion of the congressional
relief fund in this way was in entire harmony with the fixed policy of
the commission to avoid pauperizing the people by giving money or food
outright to able-bodied persons, and to afford them relief by
furnishing them opportunity to work for a good wage. A further reason
why the expenditure of money from this fund on the Benguet Road was
appropriate is found in the fact that the region opened up is destined
to play a very important part in the cure of tuberculosis, which is the
principal cause of death among the people of the lowlands, but is
practically unknown among the Igorots of the hills.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=

<p>During the earlier years after the road was open owners of bull
carts in Pangasin&aacute;n made large sums transporting freight over
it. This is not the case at the present time, as the growing volume of
freight requiring to be moved led to the blocking of the road with bull
carts and necessitated the installation of an automobile truck line so
that it might be more expeditiously handled.</p>
<p>In December, 1904, the great landscape architect, Mr. D. H. Burnham,
visited Baguio, and made a plan for its future development. He was
enthusiastic over its possibilities, and gave his services free of
charge. His plan is being closely adhered to, and although funds are
not now available for going far toward carrying it out, we have at
least avoided anything which would interfere with it.</p>
<p>The next important event in the history of Baguio was the first sale
of residence and building lots, which took place on May 28, 1906, and
was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Public Land Act
relative to town sites.</p>
<p>Although a howling typhoon was sweeping Benguet at the time, 91
residence lots and 15 business lots were disposed of at this first
sale, and at a subsequent one held in Manila a few weeks later all the
remaining lots then surveyed were sold.</p>
<p>The town site includes two hundred sixteen square miles, and new
lots are surveyed as required. All sums derived from the sale of lots
are used for the improvement of the town site, and thus Baguio is made
to help build itself.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1900 the Baguio Country Club was organized. Because
of the extraordinary false statements made concerning it by certain
unscrupulous politicians, I give its history somewhat fully. Its
purpose was to afford a meeting place for the people of the town and to
give them an opportunity for outdoor sports. It purchased a hundred
acres of land on which a low assessment had been placed in view of the
semipublic purpose which it was to serve. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb465" href="#pb465" name="pb465">465</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the outset the &ldquo;club house&rdquo; was a rude, grass-roofed
shed made of pine slabs. Its doors and windows were mere openings which
could not be closed. It was erected in about a week. Three holes of a
golf course and a croquet ground had been prepared. These decidedly
primitive club facilities nevertheless served to bring the people of
Baguio together and give them an opportunity for a good time out of
doors.</p>
<p>In February, 1907, a Country Club Corporation was organized with a
capital stock of $5000, of which $3000 have thus far been subscribed.
The shares cost $50. No single subscriber owns more than three, with
the sole exception of Mr. Forbes, who took ten to help the club get
started. Ownership of stock brings no emoluments, but, on the contrary,
indirectly involves expense which the present owners have been willing
to bear for the public good.</p>
<p>From these small beginnings the Baguio country club has grown into
an important institution. As funds became available from the sale of
stock, the payment of dues and tile generous donations of a few
members, an excellent nine-hole golf course was completed, and tennis
courts and facilities for trap-shooting were installed. In March and
April, 1908, a modest club house was built at a cost of some $5000. It
has two small locker rooms, a large living room, a tiny office, a
little bath, a kitchen, and nine single sleeping rooms. Three very
small cottages, costing $375 each, were erected on the club grounds for
the use of the members. Five larger cottages have since been
constructed.</p>
<p>Any person of good character is eligible to membership. The entrance
fee is $25, but officers of the army, navy and marine corps stationed
at Baguio are admitted without the payment of this fee, and persons
temporarily there may secure the privileges of the club by paying at
the rate of $5 per month. The annual dues are $20. The families of
members are entitled to the privileges of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=
"pb466">466</a>]</span>club. Among its members are the highest
officials of the insular government and teachers, clerks, stenographers
and other employees drawing small salaries, as well as numerous
permanent residents of Baguio.</p>
<p>It knows no race or creed, and Filipinos take advantage of its
privileges quite as freely as do Americans. Representatives of every
nationality in the islands may be found on its golf course on a
pleasant afternoon. It is the common meeting place of Baguio, and
hardly a day passes without the giving of some pleasant luncheon or
dinner in its little living room or in the outdoor space covered by an
overhanging roof at its eastern end. No more democratic institution
ever existed.</p>
<p>Congressman Jones, in his attacks on the Philippine administration,
is fond of stating that &ldquo;there is a club for officials at
Baguio.&rdquo; The statement is true, but reminds one of that other
statement of a ship&rsquo;s first mate who came on board intoxicated
just before the vessel sailed. The following morning, happening to look
at the ship&rsquo;s log for the previous day, he saw the entry
&ldquo;The mate drunk to-day.&rdquo; It was his first offence, and he
begged the captain to erase this record, but the captain said &ldquo;It
is true, is it not?&rdquo; and insisted that it must stand.</p>
<p>A little later the captain was taken ill. Upon resumption of duty he
found an entry in the log reading: &ldquo;The captain sober
to-day.&rdquo; When he furiously insisted that it be erased, the mate
said &ldquo;It is true, is it not?&rdquo; Now, it is true that there is
a club for government officers at Baguio, but in making this statement
Mr. Jones and his ilk have neglected to say that there is also at
Baguio a club for employees; a club for private citizens; a club for
Americans; a club for Filipinos; a club for foreign consuls and other
foreign residents of the islands; a club for business men; a club for
clerks; and that all of these institutions are one and the same,
namely, the Baguio Country Club, which is now strictly self-supporting
and meets its obligations from the funds derived from the dues
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>of its members. These dues are absurdly low in
view of the privileges which it affords.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Forbes does not like to have it known, I cannot refrain
from stating that the club has not always been self-supporting, and
that he has repeatedly made up deficits from his private funds. The
cost involved in getting the golf course into shape was out of all
proportion to the resources of the organization. Sufficient funds were
not available to pay for the club house and cottages when they were
constructed, and had it not been for the generosity of Mr. Forbes the
club would not exist to-day in anything like its present form.</p>
<p>The polo field at Baguio has been referred to as another evidence of
extravagant governmental expenditure. It is true enough that it was in
the first instance an expensive luxury, as an immense amount of
earthwork had to be done in order to make a level piece of ground of
sufficient size. The field is administered by the Country Club, and is
open to the use of the public for any form of amusement which will not
interfere with its use for polo. The detractors of the government have
neglected to mention that the cost of its construction and maintenance
have been met from the private funds of Mr. Forbes.</p>
<p>Returning now to the story of the growth of Baguio, the next step
forward was the construction of an official residence for the
governor-general, for which $15,000 were appropriated. Mr. Forbes had
not the slightest personal interest in this appropriation. When it was
made he had no knowledge of the fact that he was later to become
governor-general, and his private Baguio residence was decidedly more
comfortable and commodious than this official one. His subsequent
occupancy of the latter building involved a real personal
sacrifice.</p>
<p>In 1908 a modern hospital and the governor-general&rsquo;s residence
were completed. No other government official is furnished a free house.
All have to rent government cottages or stay at hotels, unless they
choose to build <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href="#pb468"
name="pb468">468</a>]</span>for themselves. The policy of giving the
governor-general an official residence in Baguio is in accord with that
which gives him one at Manila.</p>
<p>In April, 1908, there was opened a &ldquo;Teachers&rsquo;
Camp,&rdquo; to which came American school teachers from all over the
islands. They were housed in a hundred and fifty tents, which were set
up under the shade of the pine trees. Larger tents served as kitchen,
dining room, storehouse and recitation rooms, while a structure of
bamboo and nipa palm, erected at a total cost of $150, was utilized for
general assembly purposes. Four talented lecturers were employed to
instruct and entertain the teachers. At one time there were a hundred
and ninety persons in the camp.</p>
<p>The credit for initiating this very important move is due chiefly to
William F. Pack, at that time governor of the province of Benguet, who
strongly advocated bringing the teachers to Baguio, and did everything
in his power to make the first assembly the great success which it
was.</p>
<p>It has now become a fixed institution, and has accomplished untold
good. Americans who spend too many years in out-of-the-way
municipalities of the Philippines without coming in contact with their
kind are apt to lose their sense of perspective, and there is danger
that they will grow careless, or even slovenly, in their habits. It is
of the utmost benefit for school teachers to get together once a year,
learn of each other&rsquo;s failures and successes, and profit by each
other&rsquo;s experiences, forget their troubles while engaging in
healthful athletic sports, listen to inspiring and instructive
discourses, and above all else benefit by open-air life in a temperate
region.</p>
<p>The Teachers&rsquo; Camp is now a beautiful and attractive place. A
fine system of walks and drives make every part of it readily
accessible. It has an excellent athletic field. The teachers live in
tents, but good permanent buildings have been provided in which are
located the mess, a social hall, recitation rooms, etc., and several
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>comfortable cottages have been constructed for
the use of visiting lecturers and others. An outdoor amphitheatre which
seats a thousand persons has been built at small expense by taking
advantage of peculiarly favorable natural conditions. Filipino teachers
share the pleasures and benefits of the camp with their American
associates, and the &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; certainly does great
good.</p>
<p>During the hot season of 1908 the Bureau of Lands transferred a
number of its employees to Baguio, quartering them in tents. This was
done in order to ascertain the practical effect of sending American and
Filipino employees to this mountain resort. The conclusion was reached
that the small additional expense involved was more than justified by
the larger quantity and higher quality of the work performed as a
result of the greatly improved physical condition of the workers. Every
Filipino sent to Baguio gained in weight, with the single exception of
a messenger who had to run his legs off! Other bureaus subsequently
followed the example of the Bureau of Lands, with similar results.</p>
<p>During the 1909 season, the railroad having reached Camp One, five
large Stanley steam automobiles were operated by the government in
transporting passengers from this place to Baguio, and more than two
thousand persons were thus moved over the road.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unexpectedly heavy expense involved in completing the
road had been made the subject of severe criticism by the public press
of Manila. Most of the critics were entirely honest, having no idea of
the character of the country opened up, or of the importance of making
it readily accessible.</p>
<p>Just at the time when the commission should have crowded its
programme through to conclusion, it faltered. The only government
construction work performed at the summer capital that year, in
addition to what has been mentioned, was the erection of a small office
building and of a barrack building for labourers, the enlarging of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>five government cottages, the addition of
out-buildings, and the enlarging of a building which served as a
combination sanatorium and hotel.</p>

<p class="figureHead">An Ifugao Family</p>
<p class="first">The man is Gu&iacute;ned, the most influential of the
Ifugao chiefs.</p>
</div>
<p>This policy of inaction was a mistaken one. It made the Benguet Road
seem like the city avenue which ran into a street, the street into a
lane, the lane into a cow path, the cow path into a squirrel track and
the squirrel track up a tree, for while one could get to Baguio, there
was very little there after one arrived. The accommodations at the
sanatorium were strictly limited, and there was some apparent
justification for the charge freely made that the Philippine Commission
had voted to spend very large sums of money to open up a health resort
from which only its members and its staff derived benefit.</p>
<p>The government had at the outset been obliged to construct its
buildings on a piece of private land purchased from Mr. Otto Scheerer,
as prior to the passage of the Public Land Act and its approval by the
President and Congress, building on public land was impossible. Now,
however, a town site had been surveyed, and plans for the future
development of Baguio had been made by one of the world&rsquo;s most
competent experts. The time had arrived for action. Mr. Forbes, then
secretary of commerce and police, argued vigorously for the carrying
out of the original plan of the commission by the construction of
adequate public buildings. To help the development of the place, he
purchased two adjacent building lots and on the tract of land so
secured built a handsome and expensive home, where he subsequently
entertained not only his personal friends, but guests of the
government, as well as various persons who had no other claim on him
than the fact that they were officers or employees of the government
who were in need of a change of climate and could ill afford to seek it
at their own expense. Among his house guests were General Aguinaldo,
Speaker Osme&ntilde;a and many other Filipinos. It was Mr.
Forbes&rsquo;s idea, and mine as well, that members of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>the
commission ought to set the example by building at Baguio. I followed
his example to the extent of buying a lot and constructing on it a
simple and inexpensive house, thus obtaining the first and only home
that I have ever owned.</p>
<p>Ultimately Mr. Forbes formulated a plan for the construction of a
group of government buildings, a mess hall and a large number of small
and inexpensive cottages for rental to government officers and
employees so that the executive offices of the government might be
transferred to Baguio during the heated term and it might become the
true summer capital of the Philippines. This plan was adopted in
substance, and it was decided to transfer the bureaus of the government
to Baguio for the coming hot season, so far as practicable.</p>
<p>Funds were appropriated for the carrying out of Mr. Forbes&rsquo;s
plan, but before the construction work had fairly begun there occurred,
on October 17, 1909, a destructive typhoon. Eighteen inches of rain
fell in nine hours, and twenty-six inches in twenty-four hours. The
Bued River quickly rose fifty feet, carrying away trees and rocks which
obstructed its course, and seriously injuring the road for miles. Four
of the largest bridges were swept away and the work of constructing
government buildings, which was just about to begin, was greatly
retarded. It was not thought possible to transfer the bureaus of the
government to Baguio for the coming hot season as planned. Indeed,
there were not lacking those who insisted that no one would be able to
get there. Mr. Haub&eacute;, the energetic and capable young engineer
in charge, had the road open on the twentieth day of December, and the
projected buildings ready for occupancy in February, a noteworthy and
highly creditable achievement.</p>
<p>It was then thought that the storm which had done such serious
damage to the road was of unprecedented violence, but there was worse
to come. On July 14 and 15, 1911, a terrific typhoon swept across
northern Luz&oacute;n, bringing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472"
href="#pb472" name="pb472">472</a>]</span>down one of the world&rsquo;s
record rainfalls. Between noon of the 14th and noon of the 15th,
forty-five and ninety-nine hundredths inches of rain fell at Baguio. A
mountain forming a part of the wall of the Bued ca&ntilde;on split from
the top and the detached portion toppled over into the river, damming
it to a depth of about a hundred and fifty feet at a time when it was
carrying an enormous volume of water. When this dam burst, an avalanche
of earth and rock, swept onward by a huge wave, rushed down the
ca&ntilde;on, leaving complete destruction in its wake. Every bridge in
its course was carried away, and the road was left in such condition
that it would have cost $300,000 to open it for traffic. Then
Providence, having apparently done its worst, relented and sent another
typhoon which washed away most of the d&eacute;bris left by the first
one, uncovering the road-bed and making it possible to reopen
communication for $50,000.</p>
<p>The cost of maintaining the Benguet Road has proved excessive.
Mountains tower above it on both sides to a height of four to seven
thousand feet and the drainage basin which finds its outlet down the
narrow gorge through which the road runs is enormous. Even so, under
ordinary climatic conditions its maintenance does not offer very
exceptional difficulties, as much of it is blasted out of rock; but
during extraordinarily heavy storms the danger of destruction by
overwhelming floods is great.</p>
<p>While a century may pass before there is another storm like the one
which brought down the terrific slide above described, there may be one
at any time, and when the railroad has once reached Baguio, it is
hardly probable that such extensive repairs as were necessary after the
last destructive typhoon will ever again be made, especially as the
horse trail built on a carriage road grade from Baguio to Naguilian in
the lowlands has been widened little by little, until it is now safe
for small automobiles. The maintenance of the bridges alone, on the
Benguet Road, is a very formidable item, while there is only one short
bridge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb473" href="#pb473" name=
"pb473">473</a>]</span>on the Naguilian Road before the province of
Union is reached. As it runs on or near the crests of ridges all the
way, there are no extensive watersheds above it, and it is not liable
to serious injury during the most violent storms. The total cost of the
Benguet portion of this road to date<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11558src" href="#xd26e11558" name="xd26e11558src">7</a> has been
only $33,405. This stretch is seventeen and a half miles in length and
does not include that portion of the road which lies within the city of
Baguio. The total distance from the centre of Baguio to Bauang, the
nearest railroad station on the coast, is thirty-four miles.</p>
<p>With the completion of the new government buildings and the transfer
of the several bureaus to Baguio for the season of 1910 a real boom
began. The old sanatorium building had long been leased to a private
individual who used it for hotel purposes, adding to it from time to
time. A second hotel had been built. The railroad had been extended to
Camp One and a regular automobile service established for the
convenience of the public between Camp One and Baguio. The Jesuits had
constructed a great rest house and meteorological observatory on a
commanding hill. The Dominicans had purchased a neighbouring hill top
and prepared to erect thereon a very large re&euml;nforced concrete
building to serve for college purposes and as a rest house for members
of the order who required a change of climate.</p>
<p>Development began early at Camp John Hay, an extensive and beautiful
military reservation set aside within the Baguio town site. Some
progress had been made in this direction prior to the coming of
Major-General Leonard Wood. That highly efficient and far-seeing
officer gave a tremendous impetus to the work. He had been something of
a sceptic on the subject of Baguio before visiting the place, but, like
all other responsible persons who take the trouble to see it, promptly
became an enthusiast when he had an opportunity to observe conditions
for himself. Many army officers and their families who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>could not obtain accommodations in the limited
number of buildings on the reservation were glad to take tents for the
season, and the Camp promptly began to serve useful ends. It has
steadily grown and developed ever since, and is now a well-organized
army post. Its remarkable progress has been due in large measure to the
initiative and ingenuity of Captain M. R. Hilgard, who has been its
commander since October, 1905. Great progress has been made in erecting
buildings, but they are still far short of the needs of the service. At
the present writing<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11567src" href=
"#xd26e11567" name="xd26e11567src">8</a> there are many tents in use by
officers and their families. These serve very well during the dry
months, but with the oncoming of the heavy showers, which usher in the
rainy season, become damp and uncomfortable and make it necessary for
the occupants to return to the lowlands just at the time when Baguio is
growing most attractive and the heat of Manila is becoming most
oppressive.</p>
<p>The ground set aside in the military reservation is adequate for a
brigade post, and such a post should be established as soon as the
railroad reaches Baguio. The different commands in the islands could
then be ordered there in succession, and officers and men given the
benefits of one of the best climates in the world.</p>
<p>Baguio has continued steadily to develop, and the Benguet Road no
longer ends by running up a tree. The government has not only erected a
residence for the governor-general, but has established offices for the
chief executive, the secretaries of departments, the Philippine
Commission, the Executive Bureau, and the Bureaus of Agriculture, Civil
Service, Education, Forestry, Health, Public Works and Constabulary.
There are also a hospital, a series of tuberculosis cottages for the
treatment of patients from the lowlands, cottages and dormitories for
government officers and employees, a great mess hall where meals may be
had at moderate cost, an automobile station, a garage, storehouses, a
pumping plant, and labourers&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb475" href="#pb475" name="pb475">475</a>]</span>quarters. At the
Teachers&rsquo; Camp there are a separate mess hall, an assembly hall
and a fine athletic field.</p>
<p>The city of Baguio has a city hall, a storehouse, a corral and
market buildings. Lot owners who have built summer homes for themselves
have brought up friends to show them what Baguio was like. Curiously it
has never seemed possible to convey any adequate idea of its
attractions and advantages by word of mouth. Again and again I have
urged sceptics to come and see for themselves. When after the lapse of
years they finally did so, they have invariably asked me why I had not
told them about it before, forgetting that I had exhausted my
vocabulary without being able to make them understand. Practically
without exception, the persons who actually visit Baguio become
&ldquo;boosters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is fortunate in a way that the boom did not come quicker, for the
hard truth is that up to date the rapidity of the growth of the summer
capital has been determined absolutely by the local lumber supply. The
original Filipino hand-sawyers were ultimately replaced by small
portable mills, and these in turn by large modern mills to which logs
are brought by skidding engines or overhead cables, yet it is true
to-day, as it has always been true, that no sawmill has ever been able
to furnish dry lumber, for the simple reason that the green output is
purchased as fast as it can be sawed.</p>
<p>For a time the lumbermen took advantage of the necessities of the
public, but when timber on the government concessions first granted
them had been exhausted and they applied for new cutting areas, my turn
came. I fixed maximum prices on lumber which they might not exceed
without forfeiting their concessions. I also fixed a minimum annual cut
which they were compelled to make, and imposed a regulation providing
that at least half of the total cut should be offered for sale to the
public.</p>
<p>There is no justification for the claim that Baguio is a rich
man&rsquo;s city. The town site is very large and can be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name=
"pb476">476</a>]</span>indefinitely extended. Good lots may be had at
extremely moderate prices, and the cost of houses is strictly a matter
of individual means and taste. A large section is given up to small
dwellings for Filipinos. The man who earns his living with a bull cart
has no more difficulty in establishing a home there than does the
Filipino millionnaire, and rich and poor are building in constantly
increasing numbers.</p>
<p>While experience has taught me that I cannot convey by words alone
any adequate conception of what Baguio is like, I must nevertheless
here make the attempt.</p>
<p>Twenty-one miles of well surfaced roads wind among its pine-covered
hills and afford beautiful glimpses of the luxuriant vegetation along
its numerous small streams. There are building sites to suit all
tastes, and each house owner is convinced that his particular location
is better than that of any one else. One spring supplies exceptionally
pure water sufficient for the needs of at least ten thousand people,
and an abundant additional supply can be obtained when needed. The
scenery is everywhere beautiful, and in many sections truly
magnificent.</p>
<p>Gently rolling hills enclose valleys with sides sometimes steep and
precipitous and sometimes gently sloping. The country is watered by
numerous streams bordered by magnificent tree-ferns, and by trees,
shrubs, and plants requiring a large amount of water, while the dry
hillsides bear noble pines standing at wide intervals and often
arranged as if grouped by a skilled landscape artist. During the rainy
season they are covered with ferns and orchids, while exquisite white
lilies, larger than Easter lilies, dot the hillsides. The dense
<i>c&oacute;gon</i> of the Philippine lowlands is absent. Bamboo grass
or <i>runo</i> occurs sparingly in the immediate vicinity of streams
and springs, but the hills are covered with a short grass seldom more
than knee high, so that one may ride or walk over them in almost any
direction with comfort. A system of excellent horse trails affords
communication with neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477"
href="#pb477" name="pb477">477</a>]</span>provinces where one may see
wonderful tropical vegetation, magnificent scenery, strange wild
peoples, and the most remarkable terraced mountainsides in the world.
These regions may be visited with safety and comfort, as public order
is well-nigh perfect and rest houses have been provided at reasonable
intervals on all important main trails.</p>
<p>The delightfully cool climate of Baguio makes active outdoor
exercise enjoyable, and insures the speedy restoration to health and
vigor of persons suffering ill effects from tropical heat, or
recuperation from wasting diseases. Open fires are comfortable morning
and evening throughout the year, and the pitch pine wood burns
beautifully. Except during typhoons the rainy season weather is
delightful. When one wakens in the morning the atmosphere and the
landscape have been washed clean. The air is clear as crystal, and
mountain peaks fifty or seventy-five miles away stand out with
cameo-like sharpness. The needles of the pines fairly glisten and their
delightful odor is constantly in one&rsquo;s nostrils. The whole
country is green as a lawn. Roses, violets, azaleas,
&ldquo;jacks-in-the-pulpit,&rdquo; and several kinds of raspberries and
huckleberries, all growing wild, make one feel as if back in America.
One may visit the neighbouring Trinidad valley and see cabbages and
coffee, bananas and Irish potatoes, flourishing on one piece of land.
Strawberry plants imported from America bear continuously from December
to May. Fresh vegetables of all sorts tickle palates which have grown
weary of the canned goods of the lowlands.</p>
<p>Anywhere from twelve to three o&rsquo;clock, the clouds begin to
roll in and heavy showers fall, usually lasting until nine or ten at
night. Then the stars come out. The next day is like its
predecessor.</p>
<div class="figure p062width" id="p062"><img src="images/p062.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">Ifugao Dancers</p>
</div>
<p>After the first rains, which usually come about the middle of April,
there is as a rule a month of beautiful weather with very little
precipitation. Then the rains begin to come steadily again, and keep it
up until the end of the wet season, falling in the manner already
described <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>so that one can get one&rsquo;s outdoor exercise
in the morning, while the afternoon showers are conducive to
industry.</p>

<p>All of the above figures are for temperatures at a height of six
feet above the ground. Temperatures nearer the ground are decidedly
lower. It has been found that in the Baguio plateau the lowest
temperatures correspond to the deepest valleys. In such places white
frost is not rare during the months of January, February, and March,
while on the tops of hills the temperature is milder, frost being
almost unknown. During typhoons conditions do not differ essentially
from those experienced elsewhere in the islands, except that the
rainfall is exceptionally heavy.</p>
<p>Major-General J. Franklin Bell, who has given special attention to
mountain resorts the world over, vigorously asserts that Baguio has no
equal on the globe. Certainly the climate is more nearly perfect than
any other of which I have personal knowledge, and the delightful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name=
"pb479">479</a>]</span>coolness and the bracing air afford heavenly
relief to jangling nerves and exhausted bodies, worn out by overwork
and by a too prolonged sojourn in tropical lowlands.</p>
<p>One of the very important things about the Baguio climate is its
marvellous effect upon victims of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Persons suffering from this disease in its earlier stages may
confidently look forward to restored health if willing to live out of
doors under the pine trees, and there have been a number of
extraordinary recoveries among those in advanced stages.</p>
<p>A series of little cottages which can be thrown wide open have been
operated for some time in connection with the government hospital, in
order practically to demonstrate the effect of the climate on
tuberculosis victims.</p>
<p>The results are conclusive, and whenever funds are available there
should be established a settlement of such cottages on some one of the
numerous good sites sufficiently removed from the town to avoid any
possible danger of infecting healthy persons. There should also be a
large mess hall from which good nourishing food can be served, and
plenty of level ground on which tents can be erected during the dry
season. Baguio&rsquo;s potential importance as a resort for victims of
the great white plague justifies every cent of expenditure necessary to
make it readily accessible.</p>
<p>The Sisters of the Assumption have erected a handsome building which
serves as a rest house and a girls&rsquo; school. The sisters known as
the &ldquo;Belgian Canonist Missionaries&rdquo; are erecting a building
which will afford them a place to come for recuperation when wearied by
strenuous work in the lowlands, and will make it possible for them to
open a school for Igorot girls, which they are planning to do.</p>
<p>Bishop Brent has established an excellent school for American boys,
situated on a sunny hilltop. The instruction is very good, the food
excellent, and a healthier, heartier-looking lot of youngsters than
those who enjoy the privileges of this institution cannot be found
anywhere. There is abundant opportunity for them to play <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span>basket-ball, tennis and golf. Some of them
indulge in polo, playing on Filipino ponies.</p>
<p>Bishop Brent also has a mission school for Igorot girls, and plans
to open a boarding school for American girls in the near future.</p>
<p>The Belgian missionary priests, locally known as the
&ldquo;Missionary Priests of the Church of San Patricio,&rdquo; have
their headquarters at Baguio, where the chief of their order resides
and where they come occasionally for rest and recuperation. Archbishop
Harry has a modest home on one of the numerous hilltops.</p>
<p>The building of a school for constabulary officers, to which young
men arriving from the United States are sent before entering upon
active service, crowns another hill and commands a magnificent view of
the surrounding country.</p>
<p>Several business concerns, such as the <span lang=
"es">Compa&ntilde;ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas</span>, have
erected rest houses for their officers and employees, while the number
of attractive private homes increases as rapidly as the supply of
building materials will permit. Filipino residents of Manila have
recently invested more than a hundred thousand dollars in Baguio
homes.</p>
<p>But this is not all. No description would be anything like complete
without mention of a unique structure which is certain to become famous
the world over. It has been built under the immediate supervision of
Major-General Bell, who has given freely of his time and thought to
make it the extraordinary success which it is. I refer to the wonderful
amphitheatre which stands at the side of the official residence of the
major-general commanding the Division of the Philippines. Advantage has
been taken of the existence of a natural amphitheatre with remarkable
acoustic properties. Man has added what Nature left undone, and the
result is an imposing and beautiful auditorium capable of seating four
thousand people, throughout which a whisper can be heard. It is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481</a>]</span>utilized for religious services, concerts,
lectures, theatrical performances and other public entertainments. No
charge is exacted for its use, but if an admission fee is collected, a
liberal percentage of the proceeds must go to some worthy charity. It
has been terraced in stone by Igorot labourers; the trees originally
standing in it have been protected, and tree ferns, shrubs and
flowering plants have been added. The result beggars description, and
photographs do it scant justice.</p>
<p>Igorots from Bontoc, and even Ifugaos, now visit Baguio with
increasing frequency, attracted by a large market established
especially for the benefit of the hill people, where they may sell
their manufactured articles or agricultural products, and may purchase
at moderate cost the commodities which they need. The Benguet Igorots
do not raise rice enough for their own use. Formerly they had to make
up the shortage by eating <i>camotes</i>, but they have now become so
prosperous that they can afford to buy rice, which is carted in over
the Benguet Road.</p>
<p>There are promising gold mines close at hand. Their development
would have been impossible had not the construction of the Benguet Road
made it feasible to bring in the necessary heavy machinery.</p>
<p>Some of the fruits, many of the flowers and practically all of the
vegetables of the temperate zone can be advantageously produced in
Benguet. They are being shipped to Manila in steadily increasing
quantities.</p>
<p>One would gather from the criticisms of the enemies of the
Philippine government that the Benguet Road was a pleasure boulevard.
The government motor trucks transported over it during the last fiscal
year 22,390 passengers and 7696.24 metric tons of freight.</p>
<p>Railroad corporations are inclined to be a bit soulless. The Manila
Railway Company is extending its line to Baguio by means of a branch
leaving the main line at Aringay. The building of this extension is
now<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11869src" href="#xd26e11869" name=
"xd26e11869src">9</a> fifty-five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482"
href="#pb482" name="pb482">482</a>]</span>per cent completed, and the
company is bound under the terms of its agreement to finish the road by
August, 1914. In the event of its failure to do so, it must pay a
monthly penalty amply sufficient in amount to cover the cost of
maintaining the Benguet Road. Baguio will continue to develop steadily
until the railroad is opened and then will go ahead by leaps and
bounds. It is sure to prosper because it meets a very real and very
imperative need.</p>
<p>In this connection the following extracts from a letter of August 7,
1913, from the director of medical services in India to the department
surgeon of the Philippines are of interest:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;In reply to your letter of June 31st I attach a
statement showing the number and location of the hill stations in India
with the approximate capacity of each, and their height above
sea-level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to your inquiry regarding the number of cases
treated in these sanitaria we use these hill stations not only for the
treatment of convalescents, but also for giving healthy men an
opportunity of spending the Indian hot weather under the best climatic
conditions procurable. To this end, so far as is practicable, all units
are sent to the hills for the first hot weather after their arrival in
India, and they are thus able to settle down to their new conditions of
life without being immediately exposed to the trying and enervating
environment of a plains station in the summer months. We also send as
many soldiers as we can of the older residents from hot stations to
summer in the hills.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Practically all soldiers&rsquo; wives and families are given
an opportunity of a change from the more unhealthy stations to the
hills during the hot weather.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Our experience shows that the following cases are most
benefited by a change to the hills:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. All cases of malarial fever and malarial cachexia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. Patients recovering from acute diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. Convalescents after surgical operations. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483" name="pb483">483</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;4. Cases of anaemia and debility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. Cases of chronic venereal diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6. Neurasthenics.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only are all such cases greatly benefited at Baguio, but
patients suffering from dysentery and chronic diarrhoea are also
greatly benefited and often cured by a sufficiently long sojourn there.
This is the experience of the civil government at its hospital and of
the military authorities at the Camp John Hay hospital, according to
General Bell.</p>
<p>Continuing the quotations from the letter of the director of medical
services in India:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;We have found that by the judicious use of hill
stations for convalescents both the invaliding and death rate of the
British troops in Indian have been enormously reduced and the
efficiency of the Army has been increased with a considerable financial
saving to the Government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is advisable that all troops and families should be
accommodated in huts, especially during the rainy season in the hills,
but there is no doubt that they are benefited by the change even if
they have to live in tents and are thereby exposed to considerable
discomfort.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance attached by the British to hill stations is shown by
the fact that there are no less than 29 in India, their height above
sea-level varying from 2000 to 7936 feet. Of these eleven have no
permanent accommodations and are used for men only.</p>
<div class="figure p063width" id="p063"><img src="images/p063.jpg" alt=
"An Ifugao Dancer" width="720" height="456">
<p class="figureHead">An Ifugao Dancer</p>
</div>
<p>I add the following extracts from a letter of Major P. M. Ashburn,
Medical Corps, U.S.A., president of the army board for the study of
tropical diseases:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;A man can remain in the tropics indefinitely
without being actually sick, if infectious diseases are avoided. This
is fast leading to the fallacy that we can advantageously remain many
years in these latitudes. The fact that while a man may never be sick,
he yet may have his physical and mental vigour greatly impaired by
prolonged exposure to heat is thus lost sight of. No man can do his
best work, either physical or mental, if he is hot and uncomfortable.
The same feeling of lassitude and indisposition to exertion is
experienced at home during the hot summer, which after a few years here
becomes chronic.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href=
"#pb484" name="pb484">484</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of official recognition that government
employees need to get away from the heat of Manila each year, hence the
removal to Baguio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is likewise commonly recognized that many women and
children become so run down and debilitated as to need to go to Japan,
Baguio or the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is often true that monotony and discomfort are the cause
of nervous and mental breakdown, witness the often-mentioned insanity
among farmers&rsquo; wives and the nervous breakdowns attributable to
pain and strain, even though it be, as in many cases of eyestrain, so
slight as not to be recognized by the patient.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, it is the monotony of a tropical lowland climate which
makes an occasional change so imperatively necessary. Shall residents
of the Philippines be forced to seek that change, at great expense of
time and money, in Japan, the United States or Europe, or shall we make
and keep available for them a region which admirably answers the
purpose, distant only half a day&rsquo;s travel from Manila?</p>
<p>I give extracts from a memorandum of Col. William H. Arthur,
Department Surgeon of the Philippines, which are important in this
connection:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;3. Experience has shown that long residence in
the Philippines has a marked effect on the mental and physical vigour
of people not born and raised in the tropics. This is manifested in
many ways, and men, women and children who are not actually ill, seem
to lose their energy, become listless, irritable, and forgetful, and
find the least exertion burdensome. This is much aggravated in the hot
season, and very few individuals manage, without permanent mental and
physical deterioration, to live through many hot seasons in the
plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. There are in the Philippine Islands two places where
relief from these conditions can be found:&mdash;(1) Camp John Hay,
near Baguio, in the mountain province of Benguet, Island of
Luz&oacute;n; and (2) Camp Keithley, in the Lake Lanao District of the
Island of Mindanao. Camp John Hay, in the province of Benguet, is in
the mountains at an elevation of approximately 5000 feet and is 175
miles from Manila, most of which distance is covered by railroad.
Within 18 months it is expected that the railroad all the way to Baguio
will be completed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485"
name="pb485">485</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;5. Experience has shown that a large number of cases of
disease or injury, or patients convalescing from surgical operations,
recover much more rapidly in the cool mountain climate of Baguio than
in the depressing heat and humidity of the plains. Before the
establishment of this mountain refuge from the heat of the plains, many
cases of this class were transferred to the United States that are now
brought back to health at Camp John Hay and Camp Keithley. The
beneficial effect of the change in climate is particularly noticeable
in people who have become run down after one or more hot seasons spent
at the lower levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6. The great value of a refuge in the mountains from the
effect of prolonged heat is shown in enclosed reports, which indicate
the classes of cases especially benefited, but there are a great many
others not reported and not actually sick but whose vitality and
resistance are more or less diminished and who find great benefit from
an occasional sojourn in the mountains of Benguet or the highlands of
Mindanao, especially during the hottest part of the year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have quoted thus at length from communications of a distinguished
British medical officer, of a well-known and able special student of
tropical diseases, and of the ranking United States army surgeon in the
islands to show the consensus of opinion among experienced experts as
to the necessity of hill stations in the tropics. I might give numerous
additional similar opinions of equally competent men but will only add
two more statements of Major Ashburn, the latter of which seems to me
admirably to sum up the situation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">So firm is my belief in the efficacy of the place that
I have at considerable expense kept my two sons in school there,
instead of keeping them at home in Manila at no expense for schooling,
and so satisfactory has been the result in normal, vigorous growth and
robust health for both boys, that I consider the money so spent about
the best investment I have ever made.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>I state all this to show the faith that is in me. To experience
Baguio and to see the rapid improvement of visitors there is to be
convinced that it is a delightful and beneficial climate. To appreciate
the full degree of its delights it is only necessary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name="pb486">486</a>]</span>to
compare in one&rsquo;s own experience (not in weather reports) a hot
season in Manila and one there. To appreciate its benefits it is
necessary to compare in one&rsquo;s own experience (not in statistics)
the appearance of health of the people seen at the two times and
places. As recent work on beri-beri has clearly shown the vast
importance in diet of substances formerly not known to have any
importance, so, I think, are the factors in climate not to be recorded
by wind gauges, thermometers or other meteorological instruments, and
factors in health and efficiency not recorded in books on physiology,
bacteriology, pathology or health statistics.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let no one think that the summer capital of the Philippines has been
built solely for the benefit of Americans. The Filipinos need it almost
as much as we do, and many of them profit by the change with
extraordinary promptness.</p>
<p>It is really almost incredible that such a place should exist within
eight hours&rsquo; travel of Manila, and every possible victim of
tuberculosis in the islands, which means every inhabitant of the
lowlands, has a right to demand that it should be made, and kept,
readily accessible. Existing accommodations are nothing like adequate
for the crowds which desire to take advantage of them during the
season. Hotels are filled to overflowing. There are always several
different applicants for each government cottage. Many persons who
would be glad to spend the hot months in the Benguet mountains find it
impossible to do so, because they cannot obtain accommodation, and at
present many more are obliged to shorten their stay in order to give
others a chance.</p>
<p>In the early days, when we were facing unforeseen difficulties and
discouragements, I was for a time the one member of the Philippine
Commission who was really enthusiastically in favour of carrying out
the original plans for the summer capital. It was then the fashion to
charge me with responsibility for the policy of opening up
communication with the place and for the mistakes made in the
construction of the Benguet Road, although I had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>never had any control over the road work and had
been one of five at first, and later one of nine, to vote for every
appropriation found necessary in order to complete it.</p>
<p>It was the enthusiasm of Mr. Forbes which at a critical time finally
saved the situation, and now that Baguio has arrived, and the wisdom of
the policy so long pursued in the face of manifold discouragements has
been demonstrated, my one fear is that he will get all the glory and
that I shall be denied credit for the part which I actually did play in
bringing about the determination to establish quick communication with
one of the most wonderful mountain health resorts to be found in any
tropical country, and in giving that determination effect. But I have
had a more than abundant reward of another sort. My wife, my son and I
myself, when seriously ill, have been restored to vigorous health by
brief sojourns at this one of the world&rsquo;s great health
resorts.</p>
<p>It has been very much the fashion for Filipino politicians to rail
at Baguio, and now that the dangerous experiment of giving them control
of both houses of the legislature is being made, they may refuse to
appropriate the sums necessary to make possible the annual transfer of
the insular government to that place. The result of such a bit of
politics would be a marked increase in the present extraordinarily low
death rate among government officers and employees, American and
Filipino,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11973src" href="#xd26e11973" name=
"xd26e11973src">10</a> beginning in about two years, when the
cumulative effect of long residence in the lowlands makes itself
felt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baguio can stand on its own feet, and if, as the
politicians suggest, the government buildings there be sold at auction,
purchasers for all dwelling houses should readily be found. Too many
Filipinos have learned by happy experience the delights of this
wonderful region, to let such an opportunity pass. Baguio has come to
stay. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Co&ouml;rdination of Scientific Work</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Americans landed at Manila, they found no
government institutions for the training of physicians and surgeons and
no hospital in any sense modern or indeed worthy of the name.</p>
<p>There did exist the equipment of what had been called a municipal
laboratory, outfitted for a limited amount of chemical work only.</p>
<p>When the Philippine Commission arrived on the scene, it fell to my
lot to draft the necessary legislation for placing scientific work on a
firm foundation, and, later, as secretary of the interior, to exercise
ultimate executive control over practically all such work carried on
under the insular government.</p>
<p>The complete initial lack of adequate hospital facilities and of
means for making chemical and bacteriological investigations had been
promptly remedied by the establishment of army hospitals and an army
laboratory. Although these could not be placed fully at the service of
the public, they nevertheless bridged the gap for the time being, and
in formulating laws and making plans for the future I was inclined to
say, &ldquo;Blessed be nothing,&rdquo; as we were not hampered by
useless employees or archaic equipment, but were left free to make a
clean start.</p>
<p>I had thoroughly learned one lesson at the University of Michigan
while a member of its zo&ouml;logical staff. We had a zo&ouml;logical
laboratory in which were conducted the zo&ouml;logical half of a course
in general biology and numerous other courses in animal morphology,
mammalian anatomy, comparative anatomy and embryology. There was also a
botanical laboratory in which all of the botanical work <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name="pb489">489</a>]</span>of
the institution was carried on. This did not involve any overlapping,
but there was overlapping of the work of the zo&ouml;logical laboratory
and that of the medical department, which had an anatomical laboratory,
a histological laboratory, a pathological laboratory and a so-called
hygienic laboratory. The professor of anatomy thought that his students
would understand human anatomy better if they knew something of
comparative anatomy, and instead of sending them to us wished to start
his own courses. The histologist dabbled in embryology and was soon
duplicating our course in the embryology of the chick. He was
constantly at war with the pathologist over the question of where
histology left off and pathology began, and both of them were inclined
to differ with the man in charge of the hygienic laboratory over
similar questions of jurisdiction. Furthermore, we had a chemical
laboratory split up into various more or less independent subdivisions,
and a psychological laboratory. In these several institutions for
scientific research there was much duplication of instruction and of
books, apparatus and laboratory equipment. Great economies might have
been effected by the establishment of a central purchasing agency,
which could have obtained wholesale rates on supplies ordered in large
quantity. Nothing of the sort existed. One laboratory chief would order
from the corner drug store, while another bought in Germany.</p>
<p>There was danger that a similar condition of things might arise in
the Philippines. The Bureau of Health would want its chemical and its
biological laboratories; the Bureau of Agriculture would need to do
chemical work covering a wide range of subjects, and botanical and
entomological work as well. The Bureau of Forestry would of course
require a large amount of botanical work, and would also need to have
chemical work done on gums, resins and other forest products, to say
nothing of investigating insects injurious to trees and more especially
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490" name=
"pb490">490</a>]</span>timber after cutting. The latter class of
destroyers do enormous damage in the Philippines. Much chemical work
would be required by the Bureau of Customs, which as a matter of fact
later insisted upon the necessity of a &ldquo;microscopical
laboratory&rdquo; to provide facilities for the examination of fibres,
etc. Obviously there would be a large amount of work for the general
government in connection with investigation of the mineral resources of
the country, and the testing of coals, cements and road materials.</p>
<p>Smallpox was decimating the population. There was need of the
manufacture of great quantities of virus with which to combat it, and
of other common and necessary serums and prophylactics as well.</p>
<p>Here then was a golden opportunity to start right. In imagination I
saw a Bureau of Science for scientific research and for routine
scientific work, a great General Hospital, and a modern and up-to-date
College of Medicine and Surgery, standing side by side and working in
full and harmonious relationship. The medical school would give to the
youth of the land the best possible facilities for theoretical training
in medicine and surgery, while access to the wards of the hospital
would make possible for them a large amount of practical bedside work.
Its operating amphitheatres would increase the opportunity for clinical
instruction, as would a great free outpatient clinic, conducted
primarily for the benefit of the poor. Professors in the college would
hold positions on the hospital staff, not only in order to give to them
and to their students every facility for clinical demonstration work,
but to enable them constantly to &ldquo;keep their hands in.&rdquo;
Promising Filipino graduates would be given internships and other
positions on the house staff of the hospital. Patients would be
admitted to its free beds subject to the condition that they allow
their cases to be studied by the faculty and students of the college.
The necessary biological and chemical examinations for the hospital
would be made in the laboratories of the Bureau <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name="pb491">491</a>]</span>of
Science, which would at the same time afford every facility for the
carrying on of scientific investigation by advanced students, by
members of the faculty of the college and by members of the hospital
staff. Members of the staff of the biological laboratory would have the
use of the great volume of pathological material from the hospital, and
with free access to its rooms and wards, would have an almost
unparalleled opportunity for the study of tropical diseases, while some
of the officers and employees of the Bureau of Science and of the
Bureau of Health might be made members of the faculty of the college
and their services utilized as instructors.</p>
<p>As we had neither laboratories, hospital nor college at the time,
the realization of this somewhat comprehensive scheme seemed rather
remote. It was commonly referred to as &ldquo;Worcester&rsquo;s
dream,&rdquo; and one of my friends in the army medical corps probably
quite correctly voiced public sentiment when he said, &ldquo;Poor
Worcester has bats in his belfry.&rdquo; However, he laughs best who
laughs last! After the lapse of a good many years my dream came true.
The three great institutions which I hoped might sometime be
established are to-day in existence, and are doing the work which I
hoped that they might perform. Now let us consider how they came to
be.</p>
<p>In the early days I drafted an act providing for the establishment
of a Bureau of Government Laboratories which should perform all of the
biological and chemical work of the government under the direction of
one chief, and on July 1, 1901 the commission passed it.</p>
<p>I was more than fortunate in securing as the director of this bureau
Dr. Paul C. Freer, then professor of general chemistry at the
University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Dr. Freer obtained leave of absence for a year, in order to help us
get started. This leave was twice extended for additional periods of
one year each, and in the end he decided to sever his connection with
the university and throw in his lot with the Philippine government.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492</a>]</span></p>
<p>He remained in charge of the Bureau of Government Laboratories and
of its successor, the Bureau of Science, until his death on April 17,
1912.</p>
<div class="figure p064width" id="p064"><img src="images/p064.jpg" alt=

<p class="first">The wonderful irrigated rice terraces of the Ifugaos
sometimes extend up steep mountain sides for thousands of feet. They
afford an extraordinary example of successful primitive hydraulic
engineering.</p>
</div>
<p>Himself a chemist and investigator of note, he had a wide and
catholic knowledge of science in general, and no better man could have
been found for this important piece of constructive work. For nearly a
year the two of us laboured over plans for the laboratory building and
lists of the necessary books, instruments, apparatus, glassware,
chemicals and other supplies. At the end of this time we submitted to
the commission what I do not hesitate to say was the most complete
estimate for a large project which ever came before it. Much
forethought was necessary in order to time the orders for books,
instruments and apparatus so that it would be possible to house them
properly when they arrived, and the estimated expense was distributed
over a period of two and one-half years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile work had begun in cramped temporary quarters in a hot
little &ldquo;shack,&rdquo; for it deserved no better name, back of the
Civil Hospital. Here under almost impossible conditions there were
performed a large volume of routine biological and chemical work, and a
considerable amount of research, the results of which proved to be of
far-reaching importance.</p>
<p>With the employment of the first chemists and bacteriologists there
arose a class of questions which I determined to settle once for all.
There is a regrettable tendency among some scientific men to try to
build barbed-wire fences around particular fields of research in which
they happen to be interested, and to shoo every one else away.</p>
<p>At the outset I gave all employees clearly to understand that such
an unscientific and ungenerous spirit would not be tolerated in the
Bureau of Government Laboratories. The field which opened before us was
enormous. There was work enough and more than <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=
"pb493">493</a>]</span>enough for all, and we should at the outset
adopt a spirit of friendliness and helpfulness toward every scientific
man who desired to lend a hand.</p>
<p>This rule of conduct has been steadfastly adhered to. Numerous
well-known scientists have visited the Philippines and to each we have
extended all possible assistance, furnishing laboratory quarters,
instruments, apparatus and reagents, and, whenever practicable,
material as well. Indeed, many of our scientific guests have been made
employees of the bureau without pay, so that there might be no
questioning of their right to use government equipment.</p>
<p>Two important results have followed this policy. One is that we have
established the friendliest and most helpful relations with numerous
research institutions. The other is that we have been able to assist in
the performance of much valuable work which has borne important
results, and which would perhaps have remained undone had it not been
possible for us to aid those who undertook it.</p>
<p>In due course of time came our fine new building, with good
facilities for performing all kinds of laboratory work. When it was
equipped and occupied, we were able to say that the opportunities
offered at Manila for investigating tropical diseases were probably
unequalled elsewhere, and there was a deal of such investigation
urgently needing to be made. Our equipment for chemical research was
also very complete and the vast undeveloped natural resources of the
islands presented a practically virgin field for such
investigation.</p>
<p>At the outset absurd rumours spread as to the cost of buildings and
equipment, and there was much popular outcry against the supposed
wastefulness of the government. A simple statement of the facts served
to kill these foolish tales, and people soon began to see that the
creation of the Bureau of Government Laboratories was merely the
application of common-sense to existing conditions and had resulted in
greatly increased economy and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494"
href="#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>efficiency. Indeed, at the
suggestion of a committee appointed to make a study of the government
service and suggest measures for its betterment, the principle which I
had adopted was carried still further. Not only was all zo&ouml;logical
and botanical work transferred to this bureau, but the Bureau of
Ethnology and the Bureau of Mines were abolished as separate entities
and were made divisions of it, and its title was changed to &ldquo;The
Bureau of Science.&rdquo; Little by little the scope of the work has
steadily widened.</p>
<p>The scientific books and periodicals of the government were
scattered among half a dozen different bureaus and were not being well
cared for. I arranged to have them all temporarily transferred to the
library of the Bureau of Science and catalogued there. Those said to be
really needed for frequent reference were then returned to the several
bureaus but were kept under observation by the bureau of science
librarian, who took particular pains to look after the binding of
serial publications as rapidly as the volumes were completed.</p>
<p>The list of books requested by the several bureau chiefs for
reference was suspiciously long. I gave orders that each set of bureau
bookshelves be provided with cards and a box into which to drop them,
and each time a book was used a card was made out for it and placed in
the box. After six months I quietly gathered up the cards and had them
checked against the lists of books for which the several bureau chiefs
had asked, and was then able to order a large proportion of them back
to the library for the reason that they had not been used at all.</p>
<p>The result of this policy is that we have to-day a central
scientific library in which are catalogued all the scientific books of
the government. Books needed by the several bureaus for frequent
reference are placed where they can be used conveniently, and the card
catalogue indicates where they are, so that they can readily be found.
In this way it has been possible to avoid much needless and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495</a>]</span>expensive duplication. The library now contains
26,652 bound volumes.</p>
<p>We were extremely fortunate in the men whose services we secured in
the early days, and the volume of research work turned out was
unexpectedly large. The question of how best to arrange for the prompt
publication of our results became urgent, and in the end we answered it
by publishing the <i>Philippine Journal of Science</i>, now in its
eighth year and with an assured and enviable position among the
scientific journals of the world.</p>
<p>In the early days before we knew what we now know about the
preservation of health in tropical countries there was a deal of
sickness among government officers and employees. While the army was
more than liberal in helping us meet the conditions which arose, it was
of course very necessary that we should establish our own hospital as
soon as possible.</p>
<p>On October 12, 1901, the so-called &ldquo;Civil Hospital&rdquo; was
opened in a large private dwelling, obtained, as we then fondly
imagined, merely as a temporary expedient. Together with two adjoining
and even smaller buildings it continued to be our only place for the
treatment of ordinary medical and surgical cases until September 1,
1910! I can here only very briefly outline the causes of this long
delay.</p>
<p>At the outset the building was large enough to meet immediate needs.
At the time when it began to grow inadequate there was a plan on foot
for a large private institution, in which the government was to secure
accommodations for its patients, and a hospital building was actually
erected, but interest in this project waned, the private backing which
was believed to have been assured for it failed, and the whole scheme
went by the board. Then plans for a great general hospital were called
for. A very large amount of time was consumed in their preparation and
when they were finished the expense involved <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name="pb496">496</a>]</span>in
carrying them out was found to be far beyond the means of the
government. Ultimately I was charged with the duty of securing other
plans involving a more moderate expenditure. Again long delay
necessarily ensued. When semi-final plans were submitted, the
consulting architect insisted on a series of arches along the sides of
the several ward pavilions which were doubtless most satisfying from an
artistic point of view, but would have shut off light and fresh air to
an extent which I could not tolerate. A three months&rsquo; deadlock
was finally broken by his acceding to my wishes, but in October, 1906,
just as the completed plans were finally ready to submit to the
commission, I was compelled by severe illness to return to the United
States. There remained three American and three Filipino members of the
commission. One of the former was Mr. W. Morgan Shuster, then secretary
of public instruction. Prior to the time when he became a candidate for
a secretaryship he had been bitter in his criticism of the Filipinos.
Coincidently with the development of this ambition he became almost
more pro-Filipino than some of the Filipino politicians themselves. For
a time he seemed to control the Filipino vote on the commission and
largely as a result of his activities every important matter which I
left pending, including that of the establishment of the great general
hospital so vitally needed by the people of the islands, was laid on
the table. I was informed that Mr. Shuster had announced that we could
have $125,000 for the hospital and no more! We needed $400,000.</p>
<p>Beginning on the day after my return the following April these
several projects, including that for the Baguio Hospital and that for
the Philippine General Hospital. were taken from the table and
passed.</p>
<p>Construction work goes slowly in the tropics. One ward pavilion of
the Philippine General Hospital was occupied on September 1, 1910. Soon
afterward the four others came into use. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb497" href="#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span></p>
<p>On June 10, 1907, a medical college was opened. It was called
&ldquo;The Philippine Medical School.&rdquo; Its creation at this time
was made possible by the existence of the Bureaus of Science and
Health. Its staff was at the outset recruited very largely from these
two bureaus. The director of the Bureau of Science was made its dean
and continued to hold this position until his death. To his unselfish
efforts and to those of the director of health is due the
well-organized modern college which we have to-day. In lieu of better
quarters the first classes were held in an old Spanish government
building which was altered and added to until it answered the purpose
reasonably well.</p>
<p>The preparation of the act which provided for the establishment of
this college was intrusted to me. I called for the assistance of a
committee of technical experts and asked that they submit a draft for
my consideration, which they did. It contained a provision to the
effect that the college should be under the administrative control of
the secretary of the interior. I struck out the words &ldquo;secretary
of the interior&rdquo; and inserted in lieu thereof the words
&ldquo;secretary of public instruction&rdquo; for two reasons. First,
the school theoretically belongs under that official, in spite of its
necessarily close relationship with the Bureau of Science and the
Bureau of Health. Second, I wanted the support of the secretary of
public instruction for the measure, as it involved considerable
expenditure and I was not sure how the bill might fare in the
commission. It happened that the incumbent of that position was very
much inclined to take a liberal view of bills which extended his
jurisdiction. Mr. Taft, when he visited the Philippines in 1909,
reached the conclusion that I was guilty of an error of judgment in
doing this, and a little later expressed the view that the Medical
College ought to be under the control of the secretary of the interior,
because of its intimate relationship with the bureaus above mentioned.
I might perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498"
name="pb498">498</a>]</span>even then have had this change made, but
refrained from attempting to do so, believing that all would go well
under the existing arrangement. So long as Dr. Freer lived this was the
case.</p>
<p>He was a man of absolute honesty and sincerity of purpose, and was
far-seeing enough fully to realize that the interests of the
government, and of individuals as well, would best be served by
carrying out the broad and liberal policy which was then in effect.</p>
<p>The next event of importance was the establishment of the University
of the Philippines, which was provided for by an Act passed on June 18,
1908.</p>
<p>The Philippine Medical School was in due time incorporated with the
university as its College of Medicine and Surgery, passing under the
executive control of the university board of regents.</p>
<p>At this time the plan of which I had dreamed so many years before
was in full force and effect and was working admirably. Members of the
Bureau of Science staff served on the college faculty and held
appointments in the Philippine General Hospital as well, one of them
being the chief of a division there. Members of the college faculty
carried on research work at the Bureau of Science. The great working
library installed in the building of the latter bureau served as the
medical library. Members of the college faculty also rendered important
service in the Philippine General Hospital, where two of them were
chiefs of divisions, two held important positions on the house staff
and numerous others served as interns. Officers of the Bureau of Health
were appointed to the faculty of the college and carried on research
work at the Bureau of Science. The staff of the latter bureau made the
chemical and biological examinations needed in connection with the work
of the hospital as well as those required by the Bureau of Health. The
Bureau of Science manufactured the sera and prophylactics required by
the Bureau of Health in its work. The two large operating amphitheatres
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb499" href="#pb499" name=
"pb499">499</a>]</span>in the Philippine General Hospital were planned
with especial reference to the accommodation of students, who could
pass along a gallery from one to the other. The work of the free
clinic, attended daily by hundreds of Filipinos seeking relief, was
largely turned over to the college faculty, and increased opportunities
were thus given for medical students to study actual cases.</p>
<p>The arrangement was an ideal one. It excited the admiration of
numerous visiting European and American experts, who were competent to
judge of its merits, and its continued success was dependent only upon
the honesty of purpose, loyalty and good faith of the several parties
to it.</p>
<p>Then came the untimely death of Dr. Freer. A few months later an
attempt was made by certain university officers to secure control of
the professional work of the hospital for that institution, leaving the
director of health and the secretary of the interior in charge of the
nurses, servants, accounts and property, and burdened with the
responsibility for the results of work involving life and death, but
without voice in the choice of the men who were to perform it.</p>
<p>Those who were responsible for this effort evidently had not taken
the trouble to read the law, and I had only to call attention to its
provisions in order to end for the time this first effort to disturb
the existing logical distribution of work between the two
institutions.</p>
<p>Before I left Manila in October, 1913, a second attempt was being
made to secure control of the professional work of the hospital for the
university, but this time the plan was more far-reaching, in that it
contemplated the transfer to the university of control of the Bureau of
Science as well; and more logical, in that a bill accomplishing these
ends had been drafted for consideration by the Filipinized
legislature.</p>
<p>The original plan for the co&ouml;rdination of the scientific
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name=
"pb500">500</a>]</span>work of the Philippine government was sound in
principle and will, I trust, eventually be carried out, whatever may be
done temporarily to upset it during a period of disturbed political
conditions. There is much consolation to be derived from contemplating
the fact that pendulums swing.</p>

<p>The author, Dean C. Worcester, was a member of the Philippine
Commission and afterwards Secretary of the Interior for the Insular
Government of the Philippine Islands. In this work he gives an
impression of the early years of American colonial politics in the
Philippines, which the US acquired in 1898. It goes into a lot of
detail on the dealings with the Filipino resistance, the organization
of the administration, education, health-service, etc. Probably the
most controversial of all American officials during the American era,
considerable space is dedicated to rebutting the strong criticism in
