<HTML><BODY><p>Written by a member of the Philippine Commission, this work gives an impression of the early years of American colonial politics in the Philippines, which the US acquired in 1898. It goes into a lot of detail on the dealings with the Filipino resistance, the organization of the administration, education, health-service, etc.

<p>In hindsight, some of the things may appear funny, such as the before-and-after pictures the author used to show the improvements American rule introduced: before: a tribal boy almost naked; after: dressed up as an American schoolboy, or before: an old small Spanish prison building; after: the huge Bilibid prison complex build by the Americans....

<p>In the book are a large number of quotations and footnotes.

<p>Please take care not to confuse quotations with footnotes, which uses an even smaller font. To complicate matters, a lot of quoted materials is also included in the footnotes. 

<p>Occasionally you will come across a peso sign (P with two horizontal strokes through it). Just type this as [Peso].

<p>The last 70 pages or so are plates. Please do correct the text accompanying them (or add it if the OCR missed it). 

<p>If you come across something unexpected, don't hesitate to use the forum.</BODY></HTML>
